Full fibre worked for 4 days then I had no internet for the weekend as team couldnt fix on Saturday and then unavailable until Monday Workers did not use footwear protection whilst walking in and out of my house on cream carpet Left dust and bits from their drilling When the service did work there was no known difference in my service Kind of wish I hadnt bothered
Had city fibre fitted via a free upgrade  with Talk Talk Internet hasnt worked since Had Talk Talk engineer  revert back to copper connection Engineer  suspected line which can only be fixed by city fibre
Had to contact Cityfibre as theres no easy way to unsubscribe from getting emails with regards to signing up my interest for a particular address as I have since moved and I keep getting hounded by their emails with regards to not signing up for broadband at my previous address I filled in the form that they linked me to but I am still getting emails If this isnt sorted Ill be filing a complaint of harassment against CityFibre with Ofcom
Other than a little mess left behind by brick dust I cant complain about the customer care and service we got The engineers came at a time to suit me and also text me when they were nearly here so I knew exactly when they would arrive I was told they were going to be working for around 23 hours as it was a complete new set up phone line etc the entire service took 50 minutes and I was up and online again full marks from me we totally recommend
City fibre came to install our full fibre broadband today and I must say I am so impressed with the service provided by Nan and Dell  Both extremely polite and consulted us as to how and where we wanted the cabling and were extremely neat and tidy as well as completing the job very quickly  Would highly recommend them a credit to the company  In addition City Fibre kept us fully updated at all times as to times and dates of installation sending reminders via text and email😊
Very poor Installation looks lazy and below expected for an expert let alone an engineer Despite literature and verbal confirmations I was not up and running within 30mins I am on day 2 with no internet still Constant fob off of connection timedate Not fit to fulfill their contract
Absolutely terrific experience Bang  on time courteous professional and very caring with regards to where to place the routing equipment Julius and Aidan are a credit to the company They could teach some other companies I know  that I won’t mention by name  how to do things correctly oh OK then it’s Curry’s Evri and Ryanair but don’t tell them I said so🤣
Tyler and Aladin were exceptional I was advised before they arrived and Tyler explained the process and answered any questions I had politely and professionally The installation was carried out swiftly and to an excellent standard and they tidied up after themselves Both engineers are a credit to the company and I couldn’t recommend them enough Thank you both 😊
Really impressed with these guys  Spoke about a slightly tricky first floor installation before they started and even had supervisors come to help dig the garden so that they finished on time  Friendly engineers they were working very hard and despite me giving them drinks they didnt stop
The 10th engineer visiting completed the installation in exactly the way I thought it should have been completed with no complaints at speed Complete legendHe has been the only person of value to visit my property The previous 9 visits wasted my time and money I  could not move in without my broadband service and paid 2 and a half months of extra rent for the privilegeThe actual solution wasin the end as I had expected for the engineer to turn up with a long enough drill bit and ladder and then just do the work
Still up to their old tricks  They dug up a pathway at Denton Gardens Worthing towards the end of last week closed off the pavement on a dangerous and busy road by putting up barriers and there has since been no sign of any work being done  CityFibre the company who will dig a hole and then leave it to mature for a few days or weeks before they actually do anything with it
City fibre are in the process of installing unground cabling in our street as i write this They have made a complete mess of the pavement in the process Are they going to pay for the repair They have been around different streets in our area for a few months and our experience appears to be the norm unfortunately
Both Dimitri and Vlad were very polite knowledgeable and helpful  It was easy to find a solution that worked for all of us They worked quickly and accurately they hardly made any mess and tidied up as they wentThe system worked straight away
Top class both engineers Aaron and James arrived on time went through what was going to happen In a short time the Internet was up and running Highly recommend City Fibre
Trying to connect to the network with Air broadband that are on your website that do not exist anymore Unable to cancel order to go with another provider and no help from the service desk No wonder people are getting annoyed
The three lads that carried out the install were very polite and professional They were in and out in no time whilst maintaining a very high level of professionalism Neat and tidy install Would definitely recommend cityfibre
Martin  Irin did a great job with the installationorientation I wasnt able to be at home when they first turn up but Martin gave me call an hour later telling me that they will be back within 15mins for the broadband installation and they didGreat effort Thanks
During installation i had a nice conversation with Julius he was very informative about any question i had even when it wasnt completely relevant to the installation It was a speedy installation even with me quizzing him while Aedan handled the installation outside swiftlyI have no complaints with City Fibres installation team
Installation of city fibre for vodaphone by Sean and Mo in Leeds were fantastic Very professional and polite service Explained everything to me when I didn’t have a clue and made no pressure to make snap decisions Excellent customer service all around
Absolute cowboys of a company  I suggest you read the reviews FIRST before thinking about installing with this companyI’ve made 2 complaints so far one of which was closed without any response current complaint has not been replied to No phone calls no emails nothingLong story short… 1st engineer visit…December 15 2022’ couldn’t find a way to install fibre cable into property2nd engineer visit couldn’t do the install again suggested cables go around side of the house … They don’t have cable longer than 30m3rd attempt… my address is now not on the city fibre system I updated via Royal Mail4th attempt they want to do mdu installation despite me saying numerous times I don’t have permission to put fibre cables all over the house … it’s a house not a large buildingInstead of being greedy and hoping other people here may want broadband from the multiple MDU cables  how about trying to take care of the customer who actually wants fibreI do not recommend
Cityfibres install was great from start to finish Chris and Anna explained the whole process from start to finish did the work with no fuss were friendly and cleaned up after themselves to the point of even hoovering the hall Excellent service and I’m getting the broadband speeds advertised
The engineers who visited my property were extremely kind and polite They went above and beyond their job description to get my internet up and running there was an issue from talktalks end not cityfibre but the engineer did everything he could think of to try and help me get it sorted even though his installation was fine and working correctly The gentlemen both cleaned up all the mess from drilling and left my property in as good a state as when they arrived I would definitely recommend the engineers who visited us
Super fast and stable broadband Installation team did a fantastic job with the installation putting the equipment in the places I needed and the cable runs are barely noticeable Also were really careful with tidying up afterwards no brick dust or cable clippings anywhere afterwards unlike other companies I’ve used
Firstly we were told the cable couldnt go under the skirting where it would have been hidden even though theres a gap under it  so plenty of room so the engineer nailed it all along our hallway and looks really unsightly well take that off and put it under the skirting ourselves and then when we looked outside the box had been put on newly painted rendering with the bottom half of the box a good centimeter and a half away from the wallIt only needed to be raised 3040 cm and put on the brickwork where it would have been much less noticableTotally regret having full fibre installed 
I was given a time and date for the installation which was adhered to and the engineers were polite and efficient and answered any questions I had They left my property in the same state it was before installation
With city fibre via Zybre Terrible service Technicians don’t arrive at times asked very slow speeds and poor customer service at ZybreCity Fibre why do you use Zybre Look at their Trustpilot Are you deliberately not serving their customersMore importantly why are you doing business with a company whose directors have active liquidations strike offs and employment tribunals How can you justify doing business with a company like thst Are you that hard up I have had jo internet for days through Zybre  you should be ashamed
I had been on with now tv for a long time paying £23 a month and the only way you could do anything on your mobile phone you had to have your 4g on constantly
Shane and Mina were brilliant On time polite informative tidy and friendly Couldn’t be better and I would highly recommend the service Thank you guys
A good experienceLine installed at a time window to suit meEasy and very polite explanation of the process from the fitters Complete respect for my property combined with very neat and tidy work
I was extremely happy they were on time very clear and easy to understand where they were working very clean and efficient they caused me no unnecessary stress Thankyou
Excellent service with the speed advertised on the new fibre line The engineers were polite and installed the new line where I requested They cleaned up after themselves and showed me the work that had been done very happy
The gentleman that attended the house was polite helpful and had great knowledge of the jobequipment they was installingI would have less emails texts saying the same thing as can be overwhelmed with all the messages as the texts say the same as the emails
Everything went as planned installer discussed how installation would be done for my house with minimum disruption Brilliant team
Yusef and Brandon were very polite  and efficient  They installed city fiber very quickly to my property and connected my devices before they left They even cleaned up after themselves  Very happy with their service
Dmitri and Vlad were quick clean and tidy They didnt leave until the had ensured the system was working properly and supplied a new router and cable without hesitation to ensure it worked
Great overall experience engineer came on time installed everything make sure it was working properly  tidied up afterwards Was very polite and professional
The only thing I would like to know is why it was installed in a bedroom upstairs and not near a plug socket it now means I have to have a extension lead plug in all the time
Engineers Arrived in the allotted time we’re very professional and polite Explained everything they were doing in detail Also our broadband is now super fast Impressed
Finally what took 3 months of various different Kelly’s communication teams coming out to install and fix issues Dimitri and Vlad fixed all the issues basically had to do a total new install due to bad practice of original install in under and hour Thank you thank you thank you making what has been what seemed like a never ending problem to a finally painless fix You should send that dream team for all problems
I received an installation service from City Fibre I live in Cheltenham Matt and Liam arrived promptly at 830 and provided an efficient clean and professional service They were lovely guys happy to help me to feel confident about my new IT installation I cant thank them enough
if I could I would give a minus  4 contractors just turned up at my flat  They were on time but used every excuse in the book not to do the job  Terrible service  Decided against having City Fibre installed
Gòod install how we wanted it Very happy to help with the install by removing skirting boards and feeding fibre optic cable through awkward gaps etc For those wondering the cable used is black and 433mm dia terminated non user doable against BT phone cable 5 to 55mm dia ishJust to wait 6 more days before i go live
The engineers did a great job explaining how they were going to do the job cleaned up afterwards and explained how it works Excellent service
I’ve been waiting for city fibre to complete the work for my connection since 5th October they’ve been out twice to do certain bits of the work and I’m told by Vodafone that it’s still not completed why can’t they do everything at the same time absolutely shocking four and half months still waiting 😡
Arrived within previously notified time slot  Engineers were polite and professional and took their shoes off without being asked  Were happy to discuss options for wiring and were able to route cable through existing internal ducting so no visible wires   Overall the guys did a great job
The engineers came when they said they would and were very professional clean  tidy and very knowledgeable about the productThis is now the 20th of Feb and 12 days in with no internet After repeated calls to Talk Talk and a new router tried there  is no internet service I’ve now been told by Talk Talk that they think the problem is with the fibre installation and to wait now until City Fibre engineers contact me What a nightmare
The installation was very painless The information video gave us a good idea what to expect and the engineers who attended the property were very efficient professional and courteous My network is up and running as expected and I’m getting much faster internet speed Overall very happy with how this turned out Thoroughly recommend
very good job Mr Dimitri and Vlad did their job very professionally very polite and professional This is the first time Ive ever seen an engineer put covers on his shoes bravo professionalism 100 everyone should take an example of them 🙂
Good instillation quick turns up well within the time given instillation guy very informative in what he was going to do
Job was done quickly according to the appointment date got phone call when engineers where close by And they chose the most convenient place where to drill through wall with less damage to house 👍 good job
The two lads who installed the broadband  were both polite and informative tidy and professional a creditnice to see polite young men very satisfied
Came on day between times set Only took less the an hour and it was working straight away
The engineers arrived within the time slot stated and explained what needed doing They left the garden almost as it was before  hard not to churn up some mud given the conditionsOn the day it would have been good to have a 30 minutes to arrival message that other telcos use  so that I could have rearranged any calls I was due to take part in  might have been 5 stars with that courtesy
Fast instillation able to pick a time and day that suited us Work men very polite and friendly The internet is so much fast no matter how many devices are being used in the house The signal is strong in the hole house previously this has been an issue
Compelled to leave a review here because I almost cancelled installation and remained with my old provider after reading so many bad reviewsA couple of guys came this morning 15 minutes before the expected time Asked some questions and got on with their work By the time I came back from the school run my brand new internet was up and running no mess at all My internet now is 3x faster and much cheaper Couldnt have asked for more
Greg Lewis and Danny were very professional and efficient Excellent service and would recommend these engineers
Instalation was done perfectly Before they started I got explained what will be done Just cant praised them enough Fast clean work AMAZING
Greg Danny and Lewis did a fantastic job installing the fibre very professional throughout  highly recommended
Installation was quick Engineers were professionals and the upgrade was full fibre 100 I will strongly recommend your services to friends
Jake and Jaden arrived on time installed the line quickly and efficiently leaving no mess Set up went smoothly no problems
Twice meant to come and install on behalf of vodafone  Given an 8 week time to wait for a available engineer made it to 4 weeks out from the engineer date and receive an email from vodafone informing me that the order had been cancelled This was down to City Fibre saying their was scaffolding round the building which their isnt and even if it was I still had 4 weeks to get it down Tried to contact city fibre twice via email and just got an automated enquiry dealt with it wasnt so I phoned and only managed to get through to someone on reception by phoning the service desk who said theyd pass on my name and number never heard back since
Utterly poor came to do a site visit looked at the work said cant do the job cos of an apparent blockage dont know where This on the 16th Jan never told me git email from Vodafone on 7th Feb to tell me this no Internet now and desperately needed Shocking
Engineers were top class but the communication was poor on the day which is a shame as up until installation day the communication had been first class
The preinstallation YouTube video made it really clear what to expect and what I would need to do to help the installation run smoothly The engineers were polite friendly and efficient and my new connection is super fast
Very nice young men Mitch and Harry were lovely and friendly and walked me through my new broadband system
The engineer arrived early in the time slot was polite and helpful in explaining what was going to happen they were quick to start the installation got the job done with no problems so I was very pleasedwill definitely recommendThanx
Ive made up my mind to get a fibre to replace Virgin Media since I no longer watch TV channels which I have to pay for and both Cityfibre and Vodafone kept bombarding me with promo letters and leafletsThe first booked time 03022023 they showed up and installed the boxes the wires etc and then came the issue with not seeing the street cabinet via the cable Than got the first promise to get it rectified the following week That didnt happen I filled up their enquire form first no reaction Filled up their complaint form no reaction Contacted to Vodafone I ordered from having a nearly 2hrs chat and they said engineers were going to come out Today on 13022023 It is evening now and no show upI may have to think that Cityfibre is actually a SCAM and they should be investigatedTomorrow I shall have another chat with Vodafone after which I will have to cancel the order and carry on with Virgin That one is at least working
CityFibre stike again After the debacle with digging up the entire area and then doing no work for weeks while residents have their entire lives disrupted they have now gone and damaged a road bridge The muppets seem to not understand the basic principles of engineering and that bridges can be curvedtherefore digging a uniformly deep trench along them will likely cause a break through Low and behold you can now see daylight through the bridge and it has been closed Major infrastructure ruined by this completely incompetent company Closed for weeks now and weve heard nothing by way of an apology from them Theyve simply handed it over to the council to fix and moved on to digging up yet more pavements All of this is purely a money making scheme for this awful company There is already full fibre available in our area It is of no benefit to anyone but themselvesmeeting quotas they promised to meet and giving fibre to those who already have it instead of vulnerable communities who have no internet access whatsoever Absolute disgrace of a company Renamed SyFibre in our area
Arrived on time explained what was to be done and completed the job promptly and left no mess A very satisfactory experience
City Fibre Engineers arrived on time 8am Great job with cabling and installing the black box on our internal wall  They did their bit efficiently We still await broadband full fibre connection from the TalkTalk ISP and its now 3 days
Dear Vodafone Today a two member team Mr Yousaf and Mr Brandon came to my house to install the fibre router Thery were very polite as well as professional and they install the router which is working well Well done Vodafone teamThankyou
Have been attempting to connect to the City Fibre network in Glasgow via Vodafone for circa 3 months The admin was all completed early wayleave etc however CityFibre have thrown our delay after delay claiming technical challenges for my type of property due it having a lot of flats and not being able to run internal cabling before cancelling the order entirelyDuring this time I have never had an engineer attend the property or talk to me It is unclear how theyve concluded that a stairwell with 4 four flats over 3 floors is a lot or how they are unable to provide cabling within a building with service ducts up either side of the stairwell with removable covers all the way upIm left with genuine concern they are providing false information to Vodafone to avoid smaller works to protect their marginsI would welcome an opportunity to talk to CityFibre and invite them to actually enter the property and scope the work instead of giving up early
Did not leave installation site clean Small amount of brick dust on my carpet And cabel not laid very well and unprotected My appointment was 8am until 1pm and engineer arrived at 1255pm We had no text to give an ETA
Engineers were late no information given Left without service runnig Said its provider fault but now I need them back again as its up to them to get this work and looks like my installation is faulty
Arrived in time and explained the installation to me Left the house clean and tidy My new broadband is now up and running with no issues
They came in time and done a great job quickly First I was winderung why I have no internet but realised that the enginner was used the wrong socker in the modem After I plugged it into the right socket everything was working as it should
City fibre installed but isn’t working told needed new eero to be sent but we’re yet to receive it
Very professional service installing new full fibre broadband Service carried out on the day and within the agreed timescales Requirements explained fully by the engineers and everything tidied up afterwards
City fibre installed at my new property with Vodafone for pro version 900 mnps Which is setup in lounge but not good network  even in dining
Was informed prior to the installation by texts and mailed information packs and also by the engineers doing the work
CityFibre Engineers were very helpful from start to finish of the installation which included unblocking a BT service duct Thanks to them all for their strong customer service skills and commitment to get the job done
The service provided was very good and the engineer was very helpful throughout the process
Sam was excellent from start to finish explained everything fully answered all my questions very happy
Dmitrij and vlad were very professional and polite and did a superb job and explained it all very well
Had a appointment with Julius and Aidan very friendly and informative Very planet and professional
Jayden and Jake were great and made sure they explained the entire installation process to me They also provided a few tips to make ensure the connection remained in good working order
Turned up at the agreed time and did the install quickly and efficiently Left no mess and FttP working brilliantly 100 recommend

Quick service kind and considerate workers no mess no fuss with an improved Internet service
Rang with timeslot very efficient excellent service gave a runthrough of how it works left my home spotlessly clean would recommend  city fibre 100
Engineers I give 5 stars for installation processUpdated rating to 4 from a 3 because after first day troubles  all is working as intended currently
I would only give them 3 starts as its overall reviewSo installation was absolutely fineBut contacting them with any issue and talking to them is night mare
Great service from the engineers and speedy installation of new fibre connection
 I placed my Giganet order on the 19th of January Monday the 13th of February a Cityfiber engineer shows up explains my options underground cable vs ASN on pole in front of house takes notes as specialised equipment would be necessary for underground installation and then leaves I have to wait 24h for Cityfiber engineers notes to reach Giganet so on Tuesday 14th I select my option underground installation via phone calls and emails with Giganet I then scheduled an appointment through Giganet with another Cityfiber engineer 4 days later on Friday between 1pm and 6pm I specifically ask for notes to be given to the engineer so they know what equipment is needed At 430pm on Friday the Cityfiber engineer calls me tells me he hasnt been given any notes from the previous team doesnt have the right equipment and even if he did he cant make a lot of noise this late in the day and it wouldve been better to have the appointment in the morning  Hes going to chat with his manager and come back to me though He never does and does not pick up when called I explain all this to Giganet via direct chat messenger as its unfolding hoping between 430pm and 530pm when their support closes up they can intervene and clarify things No replySo even though I booked my installation a month ago Im still without internetI earn a living using the internet My income is now affected by the lack of communication within and between Giganet and Cityfiber This experience has been unprofessional and based on what Ive seen so far I would not recommend either company to anyone
Great communication before installation friendly and clear explanation of the work too be carried out and fantastic job done
The men were polite efficient and helpful The job was neat and tidy what more could you ask for
Excellent dmitrij and Vladamir were very respectful and hardworking and gave us good explanation of the system RegardsMichele lovis

Quick and easy installation Didnt even have to turn my WiFi off to do it
Well Organised Fast and Easy Installation
Absolute Shambles Purchased through Vodafone your next The one thing I will allow the blockage in the street preventing the engineers to hook up my house to the fiber network was not your fault the rest is a weird hybrid shambles with Vodafone How does it take 2 weeks to get an engineer to come out and fix the blockage not bother informing the customer your even coming and then when you are here not notifying the customer you are actually here and then because you cant somehow get someone to move their car because you give no notice cancel my Installation
Fantastic speedy service and reliable Highly recommended to people who are stuck with open reach bt or virgin media

Yet more appalling service I have still not been contacted and the appalling work on my road has not been dealt with not even sure they know where I live since nobody has actually asked So the follow ups have been less than satisfactoryFollowing my earlier complaint I received this email Good Afternoon Robin FeildThank you for contacting CityFibreYour concern has been forwarded to our Delivery Team Please note your contact details may also be passed to our Build Partner who are carrying out these works on behalf of CityFibre so they can investigateOur policy kindly asks residents to allow up to 510 workings days for our delivery team to contact them dependent on the severity of the case Kind regardsSophieCityFibre Issue Resolutions TeamWhich would be fine except that 1 hour after that email I received this Following a thorough review you should have now received our response to the complaint you made to us and so we’re marking the case as resolved on our systems We’re sorry once again that you had reason to complain and we thank you for taking the time to bring the matter to our attention  Customer Engagement TeamSo what exactly have they done that enables them to consider the case closed The road is still in a terrible state of repair after nearly a month from when they started work No doubt by passing this on to their build City Fibre will wash their hands of responsibility when they should be responsible from start to finish
Really useful guys polite responsive respectful and hard working
Brilliant service from city fibre engineers 👍

Great Instillation and fantastic real fibre
Rang Cityfibre to complain about work that had just started ts18 area stockton myself and the residents of this area were unaware that this work was planned Going to the front of my property I find that my Driveway had been Barricaded so I was unable to leave the property without confronting the workers who had installed them These barriers were not only on the public side of the road but they also installed them on my private drive without askingRang Cityfibre and spoke to a receptionist only to be told there wasnt anyone in the office that I could speak tooHowever she did reassure Me that she would get someone to call me back so I left both my landline and mobile number this was a week ago todate I am still awaiting a phone call In the meantime I emailed cityfibre the same day on the website it says they would reply the next day surprise no email so I emailed again an again nothing this happened on 4 occasionsCityfibre had to remove paving slabs from a public footpath in front of the drive to install fibre cable they managed to break 3 but instead of replacements they reinstalled the damaged flags but in such a way they were a dangerous tripping hazard for residents I confronted the workmen about the workmanship but was told they were relaid as before they were liftedI then contacted the local council who sent a representative out and we agreed with the workforce that they would return within the week to put things rightLets seeCityfibre would have needed to get a work permit from the council and within that permit there is a clause that before commencing any work Residents would have to be given Notice to all residents THIS DIDNT HAPPEN So really they have broken the contractI did mention this to the council he says that he had had complaints from other residents about this but cityfibre say that was a flier sent to residents  IT DIDNTUPDATECityfibre replied to this review and asked me to contact them directly on another email address this I did expecting a quick response well surprise surprise absolutely nothing
Everything was arranged and carried out as planned
Quick clean efficient
From start to finish  excellent  workmanship  10 
Good Internet 👍 good price 👍 good service 👍
Great lads  very helpful
Great service kind and considerate
Installation was not put where we wanted it
Overall happy with the service I received
This has truly been a rubbish experience and ruined my week First of all we were given no warning that work was being done I work from home and my house is right on the street and I cannot explain how loud it was I couldn’t carry on working as it gave me a headache and I had to go to my sisters with a migraine If we were given notice we would have found alternative places to work They also blocked off the entrance to our flats car park without any notice This was my first complaint online to no response as of yetThe second day I walked out of my house to about 5 workers leaning on my house wall right next to my door and using my window sill as a table for their tea and smoking next to my window I asked the workers to not lean on my wall and as soon as I walked away they carried on leaning It was also extremely intimidating as they were right on my front door staring When I returned home they had left loads of cigarettes ends in front of my door on the ground which is illegal and left a few empty energy drink cans This was my second email to no responseThe next day they were doing work even closer on the path right outside my door I spoke to the workers about this all they were different people to the ones who left the rubbish and they told us the work would be finished the next day on SaturdayIt is now Wednesday and the work is still not finished And now they have leaned their signs and barriers up against our wall that they’re not using Rather than putting it away Not only is this a hazard but we now have dirt could be tar all up our wall So this is now vandalism as well Have sent another email still waiting to see how they will rectify this all although I feel like it’ll be nothing Absolutely disgusted that they think it’s acceptable to not only treat our property like this but to stop people from doing their own jobsJust received an email saying they were closing the case yet they havent bothered to respond in any other way or resolve it
Fast neat and tidy work Nice engineers
Quick Installation
Great install  great guys
Amazing service

Cancelled my order even though I had already signed a contract didnt even bother to call me I had to call my ISP to find out my order had been cancelled I find this appalling due to the fact that I had already received my router and everything and Im just sat here like a lemon waiting for city fibre to show up
Friendly staff internet not working when they left but this was not due to their work and they explained fully what to do if it does not start working after half an hour We had Dimitri and Vlann Thank you
It has been discovered that city fibre cables have been installed on our land without permission  Our property runs parallel to the main road and footpath along Oundle Road Peterborough We know that one of your teams were working in the area earlier last yearWhen we were having new fencing installed on the border of our property our contractor discovered City fibre cables installed in the ground on our property   At no time was our permission sort of granted for this Please can you let me know how you propose to rectify this situation
City fibre installed their fibre in our street dug up the pavements installed the green cabinets etc They posted everyone marketing saying what was available and who to buy it from So I purchased a package from Vodafone and cancelled our virgin contract The installation day comes and the installers make the connections to our house but when they try to connect it in the street they cant because of a blockage City fibre tell Vodaphone theres a blockage and theyll sort it in 5 days I just phoned vodaphone to discover that City fibre have declared that they cant provide a service to our address
Great job by a couple of friendly and professional guys talked everything through and let me know what was going to happen and left no messThank you
Today I had Gary in my home installing my WiFi Gary was funny and friendly he made me feel comfortable and aware of everything whilst he worked I’d have WiFi installed every day if all employees were like Gary☺️
Elken and Jakub thank you so much for the service
Sent a flyer to my address telling me I could get fibre internet  After I booked with one of the operators to get connected they cancelled my appointment because they do not supply my address  They dug up the pavement outside my house and put in a connection they just cant be bothered to wire in the building
The installation of my fibre connection was completed quickly and well
The team came on time for the installation of the internet They were efficient and got everything done quickly The internet was up and running in 30 minutes The internet is fast and I am very happy with the service
Made no effort to hide cables outside they could easily have done but instead they ruined the look of my home you need to stand over them and ensure each of them understands were you want cables
I had a flawless installation experience Friendly and professional installation team very knowledgable and explained everything even brought their own shoe covers New fibre broadband was working straight away2 days later the fibre completely failed and I have been without connectivity for days and there is no fix in sight I raised the issue with Vodafone who have traced the fault to CityFibre’s network and asked them to send out an engineer promising a callback So far no callback and it is nearly home time on a Friday The VodafoneCityFibre setup just does not seem to be workingA promising start but when things go wrong it seems that getting a fix is hard work Im surprised CityFibre don’t have any network monitoring to detect outages As I am still within my 14 day cooling off period I still have time to reconsider if I get another failure after that time then I’m stuck in a contract I’d advise anyone having trouble in the first few weeks just to cancel and find something else as the other reviews on here suggest that fixes take many days or weeks
Numerous appointment cancellations and just no shows took constant chasing to keep re booking appointments Have the feeling because it is a free installation there is a we will do it on our terms approach Took 5 times for the installation to finally happen Engineers doing the install were great cant fault them Clean tidy and efficient workers
Faultless experience new super fast fibre internet connected to my property on the day I specified no mess no hassle
A most easy process very professionally installed and now very reliable fast internet speeds
The Engineers were very communicative around what they were doing and allowed me to choose exactly where the internet fibre point was installed
Got off to a shaky start as per my previous review they eventually did come back around  fixed the problem I have been on 500Mbs for about a year now No problems  very stable connection Happy to confirm everything is as it should be cant see any groundworks to the house now either all very neat Whether that is down to service by TalkTalk or by City Fibre installation of network both goodgreat in my opinion
Engineers very friendly very tidy and helpful setting up Internet
On time careful installation and set up well explained
Friendly and helpful and polite guys Installed internet quickly
Great and friendly customer service and installation went great aswel as super happy with WiFi service
I don’t have working broadbandUpdate we are finally online after 4 days This issue was the first team of installers broke the line This wasn’t helped by the fact that my provider hadn’t sent the router before the install so there was no way to test the line So feedback as not all this is CityFibre’s fault There needs to much better comms between the companies The router must be there when the install happens The second set of engineers said that it will be because the first team we’re rushing to install and knew that there was no router so knew they would get away with it
I wanted the city fibre box put in the passage where my old internet and telephone connections were Instead of putting it there they put it at the most convenient place for them Now I dont get full WiFi range in the whole house like I used to
Engineers were on time polite as well as being neat and tidy installing my full fibre broadband highly recommended
Michael and Aiden were on time made good everything in the garden and even though it takes time to settle a few minutes after installation Im getting over 230 megSmashingVery pleased
The engineers were polite  explained everything they were doing
Installed where I wanted it full fibre 900 great speeds quick install all round good experience Overhead cables so no digging needed where I was just went down the wall and into the property via the outside and inside box
I can’t fault the service from start to finish Fantastic communication turned up when they said they would and all connected and working within the hour 👍
I had fibre broadband installed in November 2022 unfortunately I had to contact my provider three times concerning this promises were made to no avail Received text message12th January saying issue being investigated The morning of 31st Jan I saw CityFibre van outside I see they had started work at my neighbours so went out and asked them if they were here to rectify my problem also They said they weren’t but asked me what was wrong explained and told them my provider was arranging for them to visit These guys happily said they’d check my outside box Lewis did so it was fine he then said could he check my inside connection Told him that would be great quick check and a phone call later I had full fibre broadband I was so appreciative of Lewis he had shown exceptional customer care  supportThis had no impact on the work they had come to do and actually saved another call out Well done Lewis  CityFibre employee
The engineers turned up on timeCompleted the job speedily and competently and cleaned up afterwards
Two install dates given by CityFibre No one turned up for either No message no phone call no email and certainly no apology They just dont turn up When you contact them to find out what happened  which is a feat in itself as the do not give contact details you are palmed off with an oh dear not up to our usual high standard text message That low standard clearly is their usual standard Went back to Virgin
Connected on 24th Jan didnt work still doesnt 2 weeks later and no commitment to resolve it They dont speak to end customers so sent me back to Vodafone Vodafone just blame them The model doesnt work for the customer
Great workmen ship very friendly and made insulation go quickly and  run smoothly nice one lads blessings to you and your familys Aaron
I subscribed the broadband package 30 days in advance from Vodafone and CityFibre contacted me for installation CityFibre was in contact till 2 days prior to installation date but didnt turn up on the day of installation I contacted vodafone and received a shocking answer that my installation appointment has cancelled Last minute i had to continue the existing broadband service finally this Vodafone and Cityfibre are worst ever in customer service dont believe in their words such a nonsense service that put me stranded nowhere in trouble last minute
If I could give no stars I would terrible customer services that never get back to you Dug up one side of my street but not the other  I was told by a neighbour this might be happening in 2025  what a joke my neighbours across the road have high speed internet and we are still waiting Totally unacceptable
Fantastic job done by Tyler and Jayden great work ethic and attitude as the installation was a bit tricky they had good knowledge about the install and product great to see as not a lot of good conscientious workmen on the go these days
Left without internet connection and I’m not convinced that the cables they laid will remain in place as they have not buried them very deep in my garden I told them I wasn’t worried about how they left my garden as I plan to returf it soon but they put the cable so shallow I’ll be scared to dig my garden at all now
On time polite
Excellent Adam and Paul were brilliant no issues with the install went above and beyond
I would like to thank Lewis  Gav the Engineers They did a brilliant job of installing my fibre broadband Good explanation of what they were doing neat tidy work and very efficient Checked all was working before they left Friendly professional very happy customer 😀
Installation team were great and everything was completed in under two hours TalkTalk had done something incorrect their side which meant the CityFibre engineers had to leave me without any working fibre However TalkTalk resolved this shortly afterwards
Dimitri and vlad were fantastic very polite and quick would recommend
I wanted the Internet installed into my bedroom where I mostly live I was told that the coil was too short and so it was placed in my living room I asked the engineers to make a small hole through the wall so as I can put an extension to the room where I needed the Internet I was told they were too busy
How do they get new businessI called their sales line to enquire about business  I was on hold for 37mins with a recorded message every 15 seconds saying they are sorry to keep me waiting please continue to hold37 mins to call the sales line Do they take Fridays off or something  If this is how dealing with them starts I imagine all the negative reviews they have had are just the tip of the iceberg
Brilliant service guysbwere polite courteous and professional from stat to finishI have already recommended them tona couple of friends
Dimitri and Vlad were greatNo issues with the install all great work Thanks again
Frustrating process and poor customer service Saw my flat was Cityfibre enabled so organised for CityfibreVodafone to be installed on 17 Jan The engineers then informed me my flat was not Cityfibre enabled and this was the second address that day where that had happened Cityfibre have not responded to emails asking why my flat was and still is deemed as Cityfibre enabled on their website when it clearly isn’t and they have ignored my emails and online forms requesting an updated installation date for cityfibre to my buildingstreet Was told by Vodafone that Cityfibre would give me an update on the situation on the 2 February they didn’t so I have to keep phoning Vodafone to ask them to keep sending complaintsrequests on my behalf so they won’t be ignoredUpdate I still have not had any response to the emails and complaint form I submitted despite them claiming they would aim to respond in one working day So I am not surprised they are ignoring this review as well
Reliable on time
Great service from 2 very professional respectful engineers Explained the process throughout and did a clean tidy excellent job Thank you both
Basically it boils down to1 Poor communication between my ISP Talktalk and City Fibre2 Poor communication between City Fibre and me the customer3 Rigidity in City Fibre’s systems conveyed through staff which meant they couldn’t wouldn’t help until eventually one staff member took it on herself to help me seemingly against their guidelines after I made a complaint and a huge fuss4 Again crossed wires between the ISP and City FibreLots of time wasted theirs and mine I am deeply unimpressed
Not off to a good start My wife has been on the web chat for an hour She has been passed around to different people and we are literally no further forward than when the Webchat began Very disappointed
The installers were genuinely nice helpful people suitable to work us older folk and I should imagine they would work well with any age group
Very professional team and good in attitude
Great experience im very happy with full fibre network good deal with Vodafone home broadband less money more speed on internet great job Cityfibre engineer
Julius and Aiden were amazing they got it all done so quickly and such a clean job too
Easy installation the staff were friendly and very informative of what they were doing and what to expect
The engineer was fine and did the job well However the Eero device cannot see the internet and I have followed the steps per the EERO app 100 Why does the engineer not assist with this step and ensure the eero is working correctly
Easy fast clean Very recommended
The engineer and others weee ok
They installed Vodafone over city fibre very quickly with no mess  And is very fast  Got this on a deal so very happy 
Very professional pleased with the service
Friendly helpful and  advice  problems not their fault
Was quick with very friendly respectful engineers and professional
Good communication and customer support Kept up to date from start to finish
Excellent communication and installation from Arron and his colleagues who he was training as they worked together to install our fibre connection There were some issues with drilling through our doorway but he repaired the damage and successfully tried another route Unfortunately the main box of our flat had a break in the connecting cable which Arron said that another engineer would have to come and sort out with the necessary equipment Arron understood the urgency of our install and said that he would prompt the next engineer to come and fix the issue as soon as possibleOverall despite problems in the process out of their control Arron and his team did an excellent job
Installation carried out without problems So far everything working well Excellent speed Their marketing partner Zen internet are really excellent in their customer services After 14 plus years of Virgin Medias appalling customer service and pricing tricks It just wonderful to find such a company
Helpful and friendly Lewis and Gav made this a stress free experience Reccomended thanks
Very helpful and pleasant did not have to wait long for them to answer the phone and they called me back in 3 minutes to get me sorted
Julius and Adrian where very helpful friendly and professional Got our new fibre line in quick and exactly where we wanted
Prompt arrival friendly rapid service
Installation was really poor Cable run not straight didn’t loop the cable at the bottom so water would follow cable into the hole Hole was drilled from inside to outside causing the render to blow they attempted to put it back with clear silicone External box lid wasn’t left on the hinge so was left open
The Installation Engineers were excellent even though their job had been made difficult by City Fibre digging the underground access point for my house on my neighbours property  The router worked first time and so did the digitallandline I got speed of 800900 megabits within a few hours of the installation
Excellent workers polite and tidy arrived on time Thank you Dimitri and colleague apologies for forgetting your name
Absolutely brilliant work Top notch service and professionalism
The installation was great Whoever I didnt received my router yet so Im unable to use my broadband We are left without internet access at home
Both Engineers were very informative very clean and tidy in fact both were very personable  If there is an employee recognition scheme they both should be rewarded  very refreshing these days to be treated so well
I had Scott and Alex fixing my broadband They were fantastic they managed to fix the problem with no hassle and they had a great attitude towards getting the problem solvedthey were very neat and tidy and were very professionalif only there was more like them😁
Great team and lovely friendly people thank you
Installers were very friendly and helpful Cant fault them plenty of advice and explaining I even changed my mind slightly on positioning No problem was their reply
They did the job and the connection works That’s a plus point but it’s holding a lot of weight to counter the unprofessional negatives unfortunately The engineers seemed amazingly disinterested in their work and loudly talked with each other about how awful it was and how they could get a ‘better gig’ elsewhere They didn’t show ID and they didn’t wear boot covers nor offer to protect my flooring They were fluent in the vulgar end of English too the F word flourishing in their conversation with each other which is to he expected to some degree but should not be blooming into life when kids are around in my opinion When explaining the installation at the end of the process they rattled off the next steps as though the information had lodged itself in each head and it was a race against time to get it out At one point one of them slipped down a ladder outside and almost broke a fence I saw it happen from inside but then failed to mention it He was okaySo as I say my Internet works Yay I have a feeling the router might be lassoed to the nearest telegraph pole and branded with a cattleiron
Polite guys… just didn’t have no internet and put cabling around my front door wasn’t even hammered in less then 12 hours some have come off…  I asked for a clean job with Little or no wires showing 🙈 the go and fit it around the front door
On time and very informative Clean quick installationoverall top quality engineers and professional
Great service All work carried out to a high standard Workers polite and cleaned up any mess All worked perfectly after install
I was kept informed of what was going to happen and when The engineer was polite and helpful cleaned where they worked and made sure everything was working before leaving
Quick efficient installation process and super helpful with any questions
Excellent  engineer was fantastic
Simple fast and professional
Excellent service kept us up to date of appointment and time of arrival throughout the whole process
Had a few glitches on the first day This is day number three not sure if the speed is fast as they say I am getting faster links on my fire stick so that is a bonus Early days but I think I will get on with it
Complete and utter disgrace of a company dug my drive up and never covered it up completely so when I came home from work I pulled into my drive and went down the hole took photos and they say they covered it and refused to pay for damages will be seeking further advice disgusting why do they respond to this as if they have no clue you they know who I am and what I am on about THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT IT  putting it in the hands of my insurance company now as advised by solicitors I’m not backing down or going away like they try to make you do even didn’t replace the edging stones on my drive way  cowboys not even bothered
Arrived on time very friendly staff
Great service today Lovely young man set my WiFi box up for me as I had no clue what I was doing Would recommend Thank you
Installers did a great job nice and neat with no mess No issues and can thoroughly recommend
Julius and Aidan have done a very nice jobVery professional people
Installation flowed
Excellent service from start to finish great communication and spoke to us about installation Very clean and tidied up after themselves
This was an upgrade on behalf of talktalk now I dont have any Internet and its now the day after the engineers shouldnt be allowed to leave until its up and running Poor serviceEngineer was otherwise ok he did wear shoe covers cleaned up after him and took care of my property Just lack of communication between him and talktalk leaving me without Internet I rang tt who says engineer visit still pending on their system They tried to get it working from their end but couldnt now I am going to have to go through everything with their technical department What a way to leave a disabled person in sheltered housing I had no problem with talktalk before this
1Julius and Aidan fitted the new broadband and router very well They turned up on time and completed as quickly as they could Also they both were very agreeable Best regards Jim Morris
Dimitri and Vlad did a wonderful work Very professionals caring and pleasant Paying attention to our installation preferences Everything done in just one hour Strongly recommended
Nice engineers very polite done a great job
4 engineers arrived to install Left me with no working internet Isp finally got it working 4 days later however at 10 of the guaranteed the speed ISP is still waiting for cityfiber to fix the issue
Install was great men were very helpful and left the ace the way they found it but as for talktalk not got a good thing I could say about them still not connected after 2 days of going live
Very tidy clean and quick installation of fibre internet
Very well done
Great service fast reliable broadband now Customer services in the UK and answered within 2 mins and fixed my problem immediately
Julius aidan friendly and helpful No mess
Amazing fast internet installed by a great team Everything from selecting my internet provider through to the installation was straight forward and easy including swapping over from my old broadband provider The team arrived on the agreed day at the prearranged time Because the fibre connection doesnt need to be where the existing telephone line is did we discussed options and placed the new fibre line in a far far better place in the house so that access both inside and outside They worked professionally at all times and everything from laying the fibre line up to the house fitting the termination box and converter inside and then testing the line to ensure the speed was agreed 1 megabit connection speed up and down was expertly done with minimum disruption and no mess The whole team was friendly and professional from start to finish and I couldnt recommend CityFibre more highly The end result has transformed our internet from years of being slow and waiting for videos to start to blazing fast with no lag Streaming multiple movies in 4k in different rooms is now possible video and voice calls are both high definition with zero noise or lag and web pages load instantaneously Downloads are so fast they happen in seconds now and swapping to fibre has transformed internet connectivity for everyone Cityfibre also offer a wide number of internet service providers so its possible to pick out the provider that works best for anyone from domestic homeowners to those with pure business needs Since installation the internet has been 100 reliable and always at the agreed speed I cant recommend CityFibre highly enough – helpful friendly professional and easy to do with zero no hassle and the price Im paying today is the same as I was for the old ADSL line that was more than 50 times slower I can highly recommended them for everyone
City Fibre have left me with no broadband on my new connection  disconnected me from my original broadband supplier  Perhaps it’s just unfortunate but so far no one wants to take ownership of the problem
I have Vodafone Fibre who use CityFibre for their wiring  Ive had multiple outages in my 18 month contract always more than 7 days at a timeBroadband went off Wed 25th Jan been chasing every single day and been told the earliest they can get an engineer out is Friday 3rd Feb Still not holding my breath as this happened last time then they still couldnt fix it Absolute joke if you want a reliable service then stick to BTSkyVirgin
Hi city fibre have been out to my fiancee 5 times with still no answers They dug up a trench at the front path outside my fiancées house and have failed to direct the small trench leading of the main trench to a box for connection so cant get it to front of house they keep on scratching there heads as to why plain and simple answer they failed to do the job properly
Still not on full fibre even though it is installed Telephoning is not helping so have unplugged it to get online with 3’4G
Keep a close eye on the engineers they have no common sence in leeds very very lazy trying to cut corners I will have to rectify their work myself
CityFibre contractor installed the new fibre to the house It took a couple of hours Only problem was when the guys left the broadband wasnt working although all the green lights on the CityFibre box said the new connection was fine Had to call talktalk and they sorted it out their end Make sure you have the right number to talk to their full fibre team on hand before the install By the way talktalk TV doesnt work with CityFibre yet Also you have to keep your old copper line for phonecalls there is no voice over Internet either With CityFibre there are three companies to deal withCityFibre the installer Kelly Communications and your provider Would be great if there was just one point of contact that would sort any problems out for you otherwise you could be left stranded Its a bit of pot luck that its going to work first time PS if youre with talktalk you will get a white cable through the post to connect to the router Make sure you have it Week after install the speed is only 30 Mbps and not 70 Called the fullfibre tech number and they checked it New router to be sent out Apparently some routers work at the faster speed and some dont Worth checking
they fitted full fibre and they day after it stopped working I reported it to my supplier on 16122022 I still have no service 31012022 I am off back to Virgin now as its a joke I never asked for the service talk talk were changing everyone over to it  I couldnt speak directly with City Fibre and Talk Talk you cant even talk to them its no good
The installation was completed but they did not make sure that the internet is workingI’m not having internet
The City Fibre and Vodafone promised us 910 MB per second but my television which is connected via cable through the router is buffering all the time when we watch live TV programmes and the speed was 42 MB per second on Sunday 29th of January and the speed goes up and down all the timeBefore we had BT with 56 MB per second and never had problems watching live TV programmesNot very happy
Listen carefully Customer and agree about place to install fibre box inside house
Installed on time despite remedial work being needed in the street following the initial survey Installers did a neat job in the house and left everything as they found it Speeds were exactly as promised
Good customer service by installation engineersThey were polite knowledgeable and made sure we get the installation right
The workmen were very nice explained what they were doing answered the questions I asked and he made sure my Ipad was working for me when they had finished
Service was quick clean and tidy polite workmen 👍
Excellent installation and amazingly good Internet
Julius and Aidan were great listened to my requests on placement and took great care not to disturb existing garden structure etc The finish on the installation was professional and a high quality finish Thank you
Installation was on time engineers were pleasant and helpful Worked quickly finished and left the place clean Broadband working perfectly Thankyou much appreciated
Nice polite engineers Quick and efficient installation
Excellent communication about the install explained everything to me and cleaned up afterwards Really good service
5 no issues here Great communication throughout
Arrived on time Were courteous and efficient
City fibre sent two of their most polite curtious lads to complete my upgrade They kept me informed about their arrival time Discussed options with me and completed the upgrade leaving no mess The team explained everything to me and made me aware of who to contact if there was a problem at a later date A credit to your company
Perfect  Made it’s easy and quick
Great service in and out 100 recommended
The chaps turned up promptly  I think I was their first job of the day  and took approximately only about 90 minutes to get the broadband installed and up and running Very pleased with how it all went Looking forward to a more reliable broadband
Overall just a great experience Lots of communication regarding installation Really nice team Vlad and Dimitri did the installation and were so efficient polite and lovely guys Would highly recommend
They came on time and was friendly He told me everything I needed to know
The staff was very friendly They explained the whole process and even dealt with my neighbours as the cable needed to be dug through their path Julius and Aiden arrived on time and were very professional They completed the job very quickly and to a top standard Very happy with the service
City Fibre have been installing broadband in the west of Glasgow for months now The work by City Fibre and their contractors has been a major disruption and danger to everyone is appallingly managed and their response to feedback is nonexistent The congestion due to their work has been creating delays and pollution for months Ambulances police cars and fire engines responding to emergencies have been stuck in the traffic delays not to mention everyone else just trying to get to work and go about their business Multiple roads and pavements have been closed and lifted at the same time creating serial bottlenecks forcing pedestrians and cyclists into the traffic No one on site is willing to discuss the work or identify a manager Even when they finish the work the quality of the repairs is terrible  unsealed roads and pavements raised ironworks potholes
Broadband installation GlasgowEngineers Scott and Alex gave me a courtesy call indicating when they would arrive at my house allowing me to go about my day and not sit in the house all dayOn arrival there were a few hurdles to overcome to get broadband connected the guys had a can do attitude which meant the job got done quickly efficiently and very tidy workVery impressed with the team If only more trades people were like these twoDelighted
Seamless installation Yousef and Brendan did an excellent job Happy with our quick Internet now
Julius  Aden was really friendly Installed and up and running in an hour even tidied up both inside and outside before leaving Thanks guys
Quick efficient installationinstantly better service after install 
After reading all the negative reviews I was apprehensive but I think most of the negative reviews are for the roadworks installing the cabling in each city as they roll out the networkMy installation was excellent they arrived on time were courteous and installed the full fibre into the room of my choosing from the telegraph pole into my back bedroom without fussWorked straight away and getting the speed I paid forSo happy with the installation and the service
Very neat and tidy installation Team making the connection were knowledgable and very professional Internet speed a lot better than previous supplier
Friendly  helpful and professional
Installation took 3 attempts first time CF stated there was no one over the age of 18 2nd time they needed a hoist which was unavailable Was then told further external work required before installation could occur and date pushed back 2 weeks was only through complaints with ISP that was completed within a week and they didn’t even need a hoist used ladders Once on site the engineer who did internal work was going to install in the opposite corner to where I had asked as it would be less bends in the glass cable and improve overall speeds despite saying I was aware and wanted it where I had originally requested seemed to have the hump as would mean stripping more cabling Once he’d gotten the cabling pinned he realised he’d forgotten to place a cap over the hole where the cable comes through the external wall and so had to remove all the pinning and start again which meant repositioning the connector luckily this is behind a cabinet so not noticeable that there are still holes which I have to fill in where it was originally placed
Helpful and professional installers Couldnt have done more
It took 3 attempts to get my upgrade but the City Fibre team had it all done in approx 90 mins
Great service told me every step before doing anything always reassuring
Took almost 4hrs to install my new internet fibre I had to cancel my own work because of this
Great installation by julios and ethan Explained everything and was quick Thank you
Good comunication beforehand about install dates and time slot   The guys who came were very professional and knowledgeable Tidy installation of wiring Internet back online in 2 minutes  Good job   super fast connection immediately
No broadband after installation since 612 Almost 2 months “Broadband” and “Service” lights don’t light up on ONT been told there is an “issue at the pole” More than 5 deadlines set by cityfibre to fix the issue  have not been  met How this is possible in the 21st century is beyond me
They kept me informed and called prior to their arrival After asking where the installation was to be placed they worked quickly After completing they showed me that everything was working and cleaned up afterwards
I had been watching the City team digging up my road for a few weeks and when I got a note to say it was live I joined up through Vodafone I got an agreed installation date of the 9th January The city guys arrived and completed the internal install from the street once finished told me they couldn’t connect it as they’d tested the pipework the day before and it was blocked so they couldn’t run the fibre back to their cabinet They told me the civils team would need to return and dig it back up Since then I have a weekly visit by a different “specialist” team who tell me the pipe is blocked The last visit was on the 24th Jan where I was told they’d need the civils team to dig it up same as I was told 2 weeks earlier They have now give me a date of the 1st Feb to review the issue and be in a position to give me another date for the connection to be completed I speak to City weekly to get the latest excuse but it really seems as if they have no idea what they are doing at all They keep sending engineers to tell me the pipe is blocked Very frustrating I would have been without internet for 3 weeks so far luckily BT agreed to extend my contract while City were trying to sort out their mess Update 310123 two guys arrived and managed to get the fibre from the street cabinet to my connection bad by my front door after 3 weeks of waiting the fibre was finally at the house “sorry can’t connect that mate” “it needs another engineer”I rang Vodafone on the 1st Feb who rang City we can’t give you an update for a week as we don’t have the engineers report form the 31st yet So I’m waiting for the 6th to see if anyone can attend and make the final connection I did email feedbacktpCity as they always suggest and got an extremely useful replyThank you for your review on TrustPilot and for providing further information I have checked your property address and can see our order desk team are updating Vodafone when updates come through from the civil’s team This can take up to 5 days from when they attend your property Vodafone will be updated as soon as our order desk team are advised However I have chased the order desk myself to find out ay updates and will send any information to yourself as soon as the team advise me Kind regards SophieCityFibre Issue Resolutions TeamAs I said before they have no ideaUpdate 6223An engineer did indeed arrive on the 6th and managed to connect both ends of the fibre so after just 3 days short of a month City have managed to get the system up and running Vodafone rang me to let me know it was all connected and offered compensation for all the wasted daysIn conclusion it took far too long the civils team installing the pipes failed to get them right All the engineer visits were a waste of time and it frustratingly takes a week between visits It is now running though and I’m getting gigabit speeds as promised to directly connected devises and around 450 mbitssecond up and down on the WiFi
Excellent communication throughout No digging what a reliefProfessional and courteous at all times
Fairly quick and easy installation engineers knew what they were talking about
Very easy to arrange and super fast installation also engineers were very good no mess
Day 1 of install  engineer needs to drill a hole in the side of the house and needed a form filled in by landlord on the form it states that the form should be filled out before the installation date Form was filled and and returned same dayDay 2  no response so called and got told engineers don’t work weekendsDay 4  still no word After calling got an engineer booked in for later this weekDay 6  engineer drilled a hole in the side of the house and set up the connection point but has not yet physically connected up the internet as he doesn’t have a way of reaching the poleEngineer said he would get it done later this week…This whole experience is not worth it I don’t recommend swapping to this provider I still don’t have internet  Avoid at all costsUpdate just been told nothing will happen until day 12Update 2 second weekend without internet Engineers still not hooked up internet Giganet can’t give me a date of install Please avoid Giganet and their engineers city fibre at all cost It’s really not worth it
I cannot get a signal in my living room where I do most of my work on my tabletif this is not rectified then I wish it to be removed as I had a signal throughout my home before all this happenedCannot remember the exact date it was installedbut it was in the month of January
Yet another person complaining at CFs utter contempt for local residents when installing their network Honestly search for them on FB and read comments on the posts
Scott and Alex went above and beyond to install my new internet connection they’ve unblocked a blockage which was apparently undo able according to previous employees of cityfibre absolutely ecstatic with the job the boys have done quick and efficient without cutting any corners Highly recommend thank you guys
Really wonderful service from Lewis very friendly and considerate  wore shoe cover cleaned space explained what the work involved and got me all connected and ready to go  Great experience and I’d recommend city fibre 100
Fast professional and friendly came in alloted time slot
Engineer was great and helpful and went above and beyond Nice lad
The engineer was polite helpful and did a great job The installer took time to discuss exactly how he was going to proceed and did a very neat job I couldnt have asked for better
This was a new fibre installation that required a nearly 40 meter run The engineers couldn’t have been more helpful changed to cable to white ran it very carefully and made sure it was barely noticeable Both engineers were incredibly professional and friendly and couldn’t do enough to make sure it was installed perfectly Both a real credit to city fibre
Prompt installation Good speed
Excellent thank you
Fantastic service from Andrew  Tex Great customer service tidy and quick Fully recommend these guys
Engineers installed everything professionally But left knowing the internet was not working no follow up CityFibre helpdesk not interested in helping at all
Great work carried out by Mitri and Vlad very informative and explained the process clearly to what work they would be doing
Great install quickly and cleanly done Polite and professional install team
The technicians were friendly They did the work fast and were able to accommodate my needs
They were very good
Engineers were punctual courteous and knowledgeable Full marks for service
Simple to order Kept informed all stages Installation completed quickly and back online within an hour 10 x faster than old provider over 50 cheaper
Very kindly service team coming The highest safety standards quick professional job and clean and tidy place left after jobs Happy to see more company like this company
julius and aidan engineer done very good job julius help to set up wifi mesh and explain everything with wifi i have very good experience with julius highly recommend this guys very polite and extremely helpful amazing experience
Everything happening quickly and efficiently On the day got a call an about an hour before the engineers arrived narrowing the window and they then arrived promptly in that period The installation went smoothly everything was clean and professionally done they even coped with my cats wondering what was going on without any issues
The lads that came round was very polite had respect for my home kept me well informed what they were doing answered all my questions that I hadWell done to lads keep the good work up
Great guys installing polite and knowledgeable
Lovely team training trainees having they take lead doing what I asked Talked me into better options
Demitri and Vlad were great  Very polite and got the job done  Thanks 🙏
Engineer gave incorrect information  left system not working
Quick and easy service  Left me with working broadband and tidy home  Installers explained everythingHighly recommend 🥰
Polite efficient and helpful
Callan and Jordan were great guys worked hard and were very friendly and courteous They helped sort a solution to fit cable perfectly with minimal disruption Really pleased with the fitting and service
Not flexible regarding instillation when my husband is an electrician and knows what he’s talking about The cable could have gone through a pre existing hole in the wall rather than a new hole having to be drilled through the wall
We had Tyler and Jayden today at out home in Aberdeen to install our fast fibre They were both fantastic very professional job was done professionally and efficiently I could not be more pleased Thank you both Marc
Very pleasant and courteous EnhineersProffesional throughoutquickclean and tidy job
Very good job boys done Dmitrij and Vlad
Excellent firm to deal with Dan Lewis and Greg were a pleasure to deal with Very friendly polite and the communication was spot on from beginning to completion of work
Engineers were efficient  friendly Service is good so far
Complained to CityFibre about my terrible luckily only near signup experience with one of their vendors Vodafone Broadband where Vodafone told me it was CityFibres fault for the issue I was having which it wasnt it was Vodafones so thought CityFibre would like to know Instead CityFibre complaints team told me it was an issue I had to bring up with Vodafone although it was Vodafone who had said CityFibre were at fault If I was CityFibre Id be acting on a vendor fibbingpassing on the blame not ignoring it Doesnt say much for CityFibres integrity or its dedication to its end clients us All things said and done Ive gone with Openreach off the back of all this choosing to pay a bit more for definitely better service

I am no tech expert but I’ll tell you city fibre’s broadband is ridiculously quick I am the guy who used to think virgin broadband was unbeatable Unlike Virgin media’s broadband  city fibre has no periods during the evening where it slows down for me that is a huge plus and a game changer
Dont damage neighbours broadband in the process please
Good service was given on installation Everything was neat and cleanhighly appreciated
Great communication from Matt my insulation engineer on the day who called and message me before arrivingAnd was very friendly and helpful and also another member of staff whos with him
Efficient and effective install with no fuss or mess kept me updated the whole time
It is early days yet but so far very impressed with the service I checked the low review scores on this site and it appears that most of those were posted by people who did not read the information about WiFi speeds or do not understand that there are limiting factors especially when using your own equipment These speeds require better end user equipment to be in place and if you complain about only 200M up and down on a mobile device you must be a bit madInstallation went smoothly but I again saw people complaining because they cancelled their existing broadband before the new one was installed NEVER do that expect a changeover period to let any issues iron themselves outIn summary it is the best value that I came across and the 900M up and down for WIRED devices is fantastic as long as you use hardware that can cope to do it justice you will need to make sure you have the right routers and WiFi bases installed consult a professional instead of making assumptions
Installation was easy and fuss free The engineer explained everything and carried on with the work A 200 improvement with the Internet
Very friendly staff Approachable and got the job done very quickly  expertly x
There was very helpful and explained everything and I answered all my question
Dimitri and Vlad today changed router and connected new fibre they worked fast and clean thanks
The guys that had tended to do the work was absolutely lovely and polite but still from eight thirty On a Monday continue in until dont know when I still have no Internet Ive made at least 10 calls to different customer services and nobody has fixed the issue and its now Wednesday at 945pm so not happy no working from home for me and no competition  offered
The engineers were really good they installed the broadband in no time and were very  nice  helpful Im happy with the work done by scott AdamCheers lads
Its hard to summarize all the failures in a short review City Fibre have been digging up roads up and down where I live in the summer last year which was a hopeful sign of a full fibre soon That was not the case However two weeks ago the flat where I live got a marketing letter through the door that we are ready to be connected I then got on the GigaNets website and went with 900Mbs package this part was smooth I got the order in and got the router few days after Then the appointment date came Two City Fibre engineers turned up and after spending about half hour trying to locate the termination point they found it in completely unsuitable place and therefore my flat could not be connected in fact they said any of the flats in my block can be connected and that this has to be escalated to the City Fibre team I heard nothing since then I decided to launch a complaint which was fobbed off with an absolutely bullshiiit answer as below Thank you for contacting us and we do apologize for the difficulties you have experiencedWhen it comes to the connection point which wasnt situated correctly our build team are aware and are working on correcting thisUnfortunately we dont have a timescale on when the work will be donecompletedWhen there are updates theyll be reported back to Giganet and then to yourself if you still wish to obtain the serviceWe do apologies for this inconvenience and this will addressed in due courseWe wish you all the bestKind regardsIn summary CityFibre are a bunch of cowboys that either through they spray marketing sent letters to people that have no way to be connected or simply make such poor installations an actual connection is impossible  I am astounded how they connect the people at all It is truly mindblowingMy advice to anyone considering using any ISP that uses CityFibre as backbone  DO NOT cancel your existing broadband until you have your Fibre up and running for a little while as City Fibre will almost certainly fcuk things up and leave you high and dryJust to note this is not a reflection on the engineers that turned up at my house they were just as flabbergasted as I was nor at Giganet  they have not been able to get my service online  but they didnt exactly give a shit either
Both engineers was very polite and professional    Everything was explained to me asked if I understood and if I had any questions    Their work was really neat and was cleaned up very pleased
Dimitrij and Vlad were both lovely and helped get me sorted in a timely and polite manner They went above and beyond and got me online fast
Friendly and efficient fibre broadband installation
Andy and his team turned up on time they did a fantastic job very happy clean and tidy thanks lads
Came on time gave me good notification and installed the appliances very clean and professional Made sure everything was working and that I was happy before leaving
Great cityfibre engineer quick connection Used vodafone 900 Happy with result
I have now had three appointments for CityFibre Edinburgh to install and connect broadband and Im nowhere nearer to getting connected First time snow made meant the engineers couldnt find where the cable was located in the road why are the cables not clearly markedSecond time no show  apparently the result of a miscommunication between CityFibre and VodafoneThird time engineers turn up only to tell me that the metal toby in the road is misaligned by 90 degrees so they cant make the 20cm connection to the kerb This can only be sorted by the CityFibre Roads people   What a complete and utter shambles
The engineers were polite courteous and respectful of my property at all times  The work inside and out was smoothly guickly and professionally carried out  They were most informative from start to finish  I recommend them totally
Very professional absolutely no problems with the engineer whatsoeverPut the connection where I wanted it no mess every explained clearly
Quick informative helpful efficient  Better than I have previously experienced with other providers We had three visits and each visit was the same I would definitely recommend
I would like to thank you for sending this teamThey were punctual kind and worked very efficiently quietly and neatly They didnt leave a mess and did it really quickly
Installation was completed on time without any problems I was left without a connection 24 hours after installation Still no connection at time of writing thisI think I am supposed to get a text from TalkTalk and my previous broadband provider I was not told how long it would be before I was connected
Excellent service with the installation and broadband speed what it says it’s ULTRAFAST
City fibre a great team spirit of ladsefficient fast reliable  most of all informative every step of the process
Why leave the premises without checking that it works
They did everything they were supposed to and were on time
The engineers where very helpfully knowledgeable and professional They discussed the process and left my home as it was before the installation The connection was checked before leaving all together a simple friendly experience
City fibre provided top level service just unfortunate that Kelly Communications who are subcontracted I believe by City fibre were poor on delivering the service
Frazer and zack were brilliant When my autistic son was sent home from school that day I was dreading the installation because of the drilling and noise They were so accommodating though and let me put some headphones on my son and get him in his room with his sensory lights on to prepare him for it before they even started the job Installation  was quick and they talked me through everything Really made what is usually a stressful experience into an easy one My son even wanted to talk to them after it Unheard of Great work ethics Very professional and accommodating They deserve a raise
Kept intouch through out the process and engineer arrived in good time Job completed within the shortest period of time All done
The engineers didn’t know what they were doing they installed the city fibre stuff ok but couldn’t figure out how to get the Vodafone stuff working at all 
Fast installation nice engineers made it seamless
Tim and Matt where great Really helpful Everything installed as asked
Talk talk did a fantastic job i definitely recommend them to everyone they have a great service very reliable great value for money and they are full fibre I should of switched to talk talk 6 years ago as they are the best broadband provider
Dan and Jason did the install Very clean and neat install Very friendly and got the job done in no time Guys made sure I was happy before leaving Thanks Guys
Excellent work from Dan Greg and Lewis  Would recommend
Having had such rubbish service from BT we have been looking to change providers for some time and City Fibre recently became available in our area  We booked a service via Zen Which Recommended supplier and had the installation today  After some initial challenges the City Fibre team of Jamie Stu Ross and Jordan arrived and sorted everything quickly and professionally  The service went live around 1400 with vastly faster speeds and a significant monthly cost saving  Well done City Fibre and Zen
Matt  Tim arrived within the alloyed timeframe They were courteous and helpful in their explanations of the work to be carried out The work was conducted efficiently with minimal disruption They didn’t leave until they were confident the internet was up and running
Very polite quick and clean Tim and Matt really knew what they were doing and connected us up without a hitch
Excellent customer service and a fast internet speed
The engineers who installed broadband at my property yesterday were the fourth lot and did a great job unlike the three lots before
The engineers completed an efficient installation Unfortunately there was lack of communication in terms of ETA Also the line was connected but there was no internet access but I understand this was outside of CityFibres control but would of been better if it could of been an end to end experience
Really nice to speak to respectful and it didn’t take them long at all really happy with there work☺️
Very fast and efficient service Engineers very friendly and knowlegable
Mitri and Vlad were very quick and efficient with the installation They were also very clean tidy and polite Great job
Plenty of emails  texts prior to installation and the engineers were very professional and extremely polite No mess was left
Kept me well informed of the process engineers were great to deal with did everything I asked for great service well done great value for money
Process not explained prior to visit so was unable to prepare for installation Not in a practical position Dissatisfied
Timing cleanliness efficiency politeness  information all top notch
Was very happy with service i was provided with Im not mrs Martin though thats my mother Im Mr Martin
After being with my previous provider for decades and them putting the fear in me I was really anxious to changeI really didn’t need to CityFibre were fantastic and I was surprised how quickly it was installedThe team were professional friendly and tidy I couldn’t be happier It’s only been a couple of days but it started working straight away and the difference has been incredible Extremely happy so far
My first appointment was cancelled on the day by city fibre Apart from this the installation was excellent
Brilliant service before and during install Our internet that was extremely slow buffering all the time is now working seamlessly and we are getting 100x faster service now Highly recommend City Fibre to everyone
On time no mess and quick and efficient service
Professional team Discussed installation procedures and treated property with respect
Engineers arrived on time had some trouble getting fibre through ducting but persevered and completed the job after aCouple of hours
Here we are again  3 and a half months on and still no broadband no attempt to install the broadband and no response from the customer email address city fibre ask you to contact either  It amazes me when I read reviews from people who actually get someone out  sometimes even more than once yet 3 months since someone last visited my house I haven’t had anyone call back to install my broadband so anyone who actually has had an installation done can count themselves very lucky  I would like to know the secret
They did very well indeed was really pleased
From the first contact with them I felt very assured that they would be great to deal with and I must say that the 2 guys who came and installed my broadband were first class overall City fibre done a fantastic job
George and Adam were the operatives So polite so clean and efficient The weather was abysmal but they took extreme care not leave a trace of any mess in my home Every part of the work was explained to me this resulted in a very satisfied customer I hope that they will receive some praise from City Fibre My provider is Talk Talk
The enginners came and installed but the internet didnt work and i am still using the old connection It was a complete waste of time They should have insured the new connection worked instead nothing happened Very disappointedSarala
Engineers were very helpful and professional The planning team need to be a bit more informative with regards regards to the appointment times Appt time 81 however if they turn up at 1 it’s another 2 hours from that which makes it 3pm No info on how many appts before you etc
Initial install booked for 30th Dec but they cancelled 2nd install booked 18th Jan Install was started on 18th Jan 8am to 1pm they arrived at 340pm and it got too dark for them Appointment made for 19th 8am to 1pm to complete install arrived 330pm and did not complete 3rd appointment made for 27th Jan to complete install I hope for final time between 8am and 1pm hoping they dont arrive at 4pm this time Will have been without home access for 8 days and not happy in the slightest Wishing I had not agreed to the full fibre upgrade now A pity I cant give 0 stars out of 5 as I think 1 star is very generous
Danny Lewis and Greg did a great job Very professional
really fast and easy install really pleased
Talk talk offered me an free upgrade to city fibre to work together with themThey came and added a second WiFi box but Im now left with two WiFi passwords and cant use both at so time
Kept me fully informed at all stages Engineers were friendlypleasant polite and collaborative throughout installation Both are a credit to Kelly Communications and City Fibre
Very helpful workmen pleasent reliable  cleaned up after there visit
Badly drilled hole in the wrong place had to leave to buy filler filled the hole badlyDrilled a new hole put the box on the wall slightly wonky Work wasnt completed because the engineer had not closed a previous job on his device so he left saying he would do that then close my job after I had to book the engineers back to complete the work 2 weeks later my wifi was then on
Mud was left all over my driveway which I had to sweep up The outside cable installation was poor Cables clipped to the house were not level the clips weren’t evenly spaced some clips were loose there was too much slack in the cable The cable buried underground were very shallow less than one inch which could easily get damaged
Very efficient service all good staff involved in the chain very happy
Quick clean and tidy install Polite workmen and friendly
Great installation by engineers dave and Mike Really friendly and respectful of the property Confirmed fibre connection before leaving and explained next steps fully
Dimitri and Vlad were friendly quick and very professional
Lads was spot on and was nice quick and left no mess
Kept getting letters to say that fibre was now in the area I then upgraded my broadband that was already through Vodafone for city fibre to cancel the order because “it was not available at this time” Waste of time installing it in the street
Ross  Chris did an amazing job and a great install despite it being awkward and difficult they made it work would highly recommend
the care determination and completion of work in horrible weather was brilliant
The two engineers that came to install the fibre broadband where very professional polite and explained everything that they were doing Unfortunately I didnt get there names but Id like to say Thank You guys Good Job
I m not happy with the installation of the brown box outside the houseIt s not safeAnybody can break or damage itI wish it had been installed behind my gate door but the engineer refused to do it
What went right Nothing A total shower who take no responsibility for their own promises or those of their subcontractors Any complaints are initially ignored then if pressed result in legalistically worded rejection of any responsibility This even when a socalled manager has made a promise to the customer
After not turning up for the first appointment which was booked I didnt hold my breath that anyone would turn up today However they did and I am satisfied with everything They were polite and efficient They explained what they would be doing and then got on with the job They worked hard and cleared up after themselves Everything is working well Very satisfied
Nice service Good people
Steve the Engineer with whom I spoke briefly was really friendly and explained everything clearly before and after the job Both engineers who attended the job were very respectful taking care to minimise the noise and disruption of the installation and left the working area clean afterwards This is how it should be done
Dont make the move  Existing line cut off and was meant to go live in September 2022  They remove the old copper line too so no going back  Still no internet come 20012023  Told works needed will be reviewed 20022023  No end in sight  5 months with no internet but they say i should be grateful for the £525 per day up to 60days compensation  £300 compo for 5 months without the internet
Trouble free no hassle installation of the fibre line great communication from Vodaphone
Where do I start I have been waiting for fibre to be installed in our road for literally years so when I saw CityFibre putting in a network in our neighbourhood I was elated Unfortunately the properties in our road are leasehold so it was skipped from the rollout I emailed and was told that because our road is private its actually been adopted by the council I would need to provide a Wayleave to give CityFibre permission to install I emailed the relevant team to try and have a discussion with someone and when I didnt get a response I followed up with numerous phone calls There was never anyone free to speak to me so I had to leave messages that were never returned Today after 4 months of trying I have given up As a review I cant speak to the quality of their service or the Customer Service experience of this company but in terms of just dealing with them trying to buy their product they are hopeless I was trying to arrange giving them access to nearly 30 houses that they wouldnt have had access to before and they cant even return a phone call If I could give them no stars I would
I had John and Daniel instal my talk talk and they were very professional John talked me through the app and helped me set it up
Im in Aberdeen and the roads and pavements are treacherous Im a carer going round elderly clients homes to look after them  no drives or car parks gritted if it hadnt been for a lovely young man called Ian that works for city fibre I would be in AE with a broken leg or arm he came to my rescue helped me across the car park and the path and then went and sanded the car park and path  thank you so much Ian and well done city fibre loveky young man The Maucauly Aberdeen
My insulation was an afternoon appointment I got a phone call to say they were 15 minutes awayThe guy was very helpful with moving a couple bits of furniture for me so he could install the equipment Very pleasant workforce job done they helped put the furniture back happy customer
Although installation team were great They left with saying internet should be on after 20 minsIf they would have stayed they would have realised I had no internet and been able to rectify quicker than meAfter being on the phone after 3 hours and all the checks possible finding out connection access hasn’t been finalisedBut if they stayed the would of sorted it out much quicker even though it wasn’t there fault
The engineer was rude unhelpful told lies and refused to do the job
Quick efficient rectifying of problemExtremely pleasant and non intrusive team
Quietly got on with the job very polite and did a great job and left no mess would recommend to friendsfamily
The Installation team arrived on time despite severe road congestion in the area They were polite helpful and efficient They explained the options regarding the position of the installation etc And were able to place the cable where we wanted it They were excellent compared to the cowboys that Virgin use for their installation
Just got a CityFibre install done and the guys were absolutely fantastic  Came when they said did a really neat job tidied up were polite and left us with a new faster broadband service with Brawband  All of this done in the most miserable of cold snowy weather What more can be said
Absolutely brilliant service Very quick to come out for installation staff very polite  professional Internet speeds are really fast Would highly recommend  very happy
Jake and jayden did a good job with installation nice and professional with a quick work time1010
Lewis did a very thorough and professional job
Huge thanks to Kevin and Paul for going over and above to complete my install Shame not all engineers are as good as these two professional and fast got the job done despite challenges
City fibreamazing installation service provided
Engineers need to ensure if they are able to carry out the installation in advance instead of wasting customer’s time Installation on the 3rd attempt is not acceptable despite technicians doing a good job on the day
I have had multiple emails saying cityfibre was available but then when I tried to get a connection it wasn’t I then emailed cityfibre to ask if there was any chance that might change and got an email to say they had responded and closed the case… but they hadn’t actually responded Not a great experience
I would just like to say a very big ‘Thank you’ to Grant and Jacob from City Fibre The guys visited my 90 year old Mum and myself today to install fibre at Mum’s house They were both very professional helpful and kind to us both It’s a absolute pleasure to deal with such friendly people Thanks very much guys 😊
Steve and Nathan visited our property to install our fibre broadband We were very impressed with both of them They kept us up to date with everything they did and explained everything in laymans terms and completed a excellent installation Highly recommended
Just had fibre broadband installed today by the fibre broadband team excellent service given and they showed me how the fibre broadband works aswell Top notch stuff happy to recommend to many
The first appointment yougave me nobody turned upI should have beencontacted to advise me ofthe situation but nothing They didn’t apologise until a long time laterVery frustrating Yesterdaythe engineers were efficientin their work but left me witha router showing red oninternet and said that it wasupdating the software and ifit didnt work to report it andthey would come back Itdidnt work and I spent overan hour with TalkTalk toresolve the problemI believe they should havewaited until my router wasup and running Overall apoor performancePS City Fibre have now replied and it doesn’t make sense Why do I need to be updated I guess it’s an automated standard reply
Now on the third day of a simple install  engineers arrived without proper kit  Then received kit but faulty came back a second day and still not resolved  Now the cheek of asking me to charge one of their units  Not a great experience——UPDATE  email complaint logged 17 Jan City Fibre automatic email saying response will be normally within 1 working day Now 23 Jan and no call or email
Was really dissapointed in trying to get the team to turn up it took us to the 3rd attempt to be satisfied But once the job was started was very satisfied with the outcome
The Engineers clearly explained process and cables required They ensured all outside cables were hidden and not unsightly Great service
They contacted me before arrival wore appropriate kit and were prepared for any work they needed to carry out then left once they confirmed I was fully connected
The crew that attended were professional and helpful
Engineers arrived on time for the time slot giventhey were efficient and polite They explained the process and executed it with no fuss
The team arrived and overcame significant obstacles that they weren’t anticipatingI had been set expectations by previous subcontractor visit and discussions with their management that a “Toby box” would need fitting and ground work to the property as the OpenReach ducting was inaccessibleA date the 27th was set for this via text and I booked the day off work as I work from home and require internetThe router was issued for delivery on the 19th ahead of installI then received a text telling me the install would now go ahead on the 18th So I had to change my day off to my employers inconvenience without normal notification period So the subcontractor arrived prior to the delivery of the router with no expectation of the type of installation described above and I was in dismay However City Fibre had a ride along assessor with the Install team LeeHe was determined to provide a solution and investigated the possibility of a “normal” install by exposing the existing ductingIt took some agreed cutting up 6x6cm of flooring in a garage room that had been built over the ducting more than 15 years before we purchased the home and this exposed the BTopenreach line and made the install possibleAs it turned out the router arrived early and Lee had stayed onsite so he installed the router going above and beyond to resolve poor expectation management and communicationHis customer handling skills were excellent and hopefully the team with him learned a lot from that experience They were all brilliant Respectful and polite and due to my disabilities they helped themselves to brews and left a very tidy and clean installation with fully tested and high speed fibre to the propertyOverall the service on the day was exceptional once they overcame the poor expectation setting
Julius and Aiden did a brilliant job Arrived on time and were very helpful Very pleased
The installation went great engineers were professional connection is strong and I am happy with the amazing work CityFiber has done in my property
Arrived at the time stated very polite engineers and completed the installation quickly
On 26 April last year City Fibre on behalf of my Talk Talk were booked to come to my home to arrange full fibre service broadband between 1  6 pm Despite receiving both sms and email confirmation of the appointment from both CF and TT the CF engineer didnt turn up and didnt contact me to say they werent coming When I phoned TT the next day to let them know I didnt receive a conclusive reason for CF not turning up I am posting this review now because City Fibre have recently started dropping unsolicited mail drops thro my door  telling me how wonderful they are
My mum had had 3 missed engineer appointments to install the broadband She wasn’t at least informed that they weren’t going to attend Ridiculous guys that you can’t even communicate with my mum She lost holiday time and now her job is threatened because she’s without broadband You guys are truly awful 😣
Our biggest regret was to go with city fibre We were supposed to go live with Vodafone at the beginning of November 25 months later still no internet access in our house Every time we call for an update we are told that city fibre will be reviewing our case a few days on or a week on from when we call Then when we call back on the given ‘review date’ we are fobbed off with another date This has happened 6 times It’s just not acceptable A few weeks is within reason but hitting nearly 3 months is just absolutely ridiculous I would strongly advise you all avoid using city fibre at all costs
Really professional installation  Team very friendly and helpful  Did an excellent job Connected router and explained how it works  BIG thanks to Julius and Aidan Great job Thanks
Our experience has been absolutely shocking and we are now left without any proper working internet at home and nothing is being done about it I just cannot understand how this is acceptable We had the new installation on 18th December but the internet has never worked The guys who fitted it said to wait an hour and it should be fine if not to call cityfibre and it wouldnt be a problemWe have called countless times going over the exact same things again and again The first few calls people kept telling us to turn off for 30 minutes then restar then it will be ok After the 6th time of being told this it finally sounded like somebody was listening to us he told us we had an old router so this is why its not working and he would send one to us immediately The router arrived a couple of days later its the exact same router that we already had So another phone call to be told that this wasnt the issue and we in fact had the right router all alongIve genuinely lost count of how many times we have phoned The last call I was on the line for an hour and 10 minutes the guy said he was escalating the issue and we would hear from back within a few days Its been a week and a half now Phoned again same old rubbish Why is nobody doing anything Im resorting to leaving a negative review in the hope it will get seen and somebody will do something
Just had Ross Chris and Aiden round to install my fibre broadband They were prompt polite and went above and beyond what I would expect to deliver a very professional service I could not be happier and would thoroughly recommend
Great service the lades hasratdallas and kieth very professional
Engineers explained everything and were very efficient  clean and tidy
Good fast and clean job
Very polite well manered and got on with the job
Their contractor blocked up my drains while digging up the road I’ve never been paid back Terrible customer service Wouldn’t touch this broadband with a barge pole
3 appointments made and 3 times the engineers didnt turn up Have now made a complaint to City Fibre and Ill wait to see what excuses they come up with Ive lost faith and interest that they will ever upgrade my broadband Disappointing to say the least
Quick and easy installation Left all in good working orderOnly complaint  far too many texts and emails reminding me of the installation appointment
Helpfully with questions asked and simple and quick
We just moved into our new house and got broadband installed The guys were very good installed the fibre efficiently and were very professional I highly recommend
Fuss free installing by profession engineers Very polite very clean and boo mess left after drilling walls A full explication was given and they left They even explained how the fibre worked and showed me the equipment Very very impressed and will certainly sing their praises to my friends
Terrible experience the engineer came to my house and drilled so many holes on the walls but he left the house without making sure the Internet is working Nothing is working after the job has completed
Quick work was tidy
Great Service from Dimitri and Vlad Discreet fast and the internet speed is exactly as mentioned
Mud on Carpets Fibre line dangling in Trees
The engineers were very helpful and they explained everything that was going on and what I need to do when  they had finished there work
I signed up to Octaplus on the 5th of September 2022 with the installation to take place on the 15th of September 2022CityFibre sent out Kelly Communications to complete this work sadly the first two people that arrived could not get the rod through from the house to the BT box in the street they closed this down as could not complete the job  I got back onto Octaplus to get it sorted  I have 13 crews out to sort this job the CityFibre junction for the cable to be connected to but still no fibre attached  I spoke to Octaplus last week who have advised a fibre specialist would be out on the 16th January 2023 needles to say they have not turned upWhen you try contacting the customer helpline number they tell you to call your supplier as CityFibre will not talk to the end userFurther update to this saga  Today 10th February 2023 and with a manager coming up from Brighton my fibre has finally been connected  A big thank you Tracey Wilson who pushed for this to happen
Great installation team quick and clean love the new broadband
Engineer did not turn up on the three previous visits and I wasnt notified at all Which I had to take holidays from work for This costs money and affects valuable family time when working alot away from homeHowever the engineers that did eventually turn up were professional and polite
Weve just had Jack Tomlison  hes very pleasant team to install internetExcellent customer service polite explained what needed to be done Very professional teamId recommend these willing young men to my friends anytime
The appointment went well was quick tidy guys were friendly and explained everything very clearly Internet was working at the end couldnt have gone better really Minimal disruption
Engineers explained the process before starting work and although it was more complicated than I imagined as they had to lift block paving which I was quite nervous about agreeing to they did a very tidy job and left my property with no mess and I couldn’t even see where they’d lifted the block paving The cable coming out of my house is much smaller than virgin cable and almost invisibly laid to the small brown box near the front door My livingroom is on 1st floor so not an easy installation Highly recommend changing to cityfibre the internet I now have is amazing 100gb up and download
Engineers come on time explained all the procedure quick and clean installation All details been offered Happy customer
Great engineers Very happy with service
Brilliant service from start to finish My wife was in on her own the two engineers were polite and hard working Great job
Very kind friendly helpful quick and thorough engineers Called me 15 minutes before arrival and explained everything
Great team communication was great Turned up on time Cleaned all mess up and talked my way through it all Great bunch rate them to anyone 
Jason and Dan were greatThey turned up on time we’re very discreet in the houseExplained the work they were going to do and finished in a very timely manner Top lads professional and very pleasant to deal with Overall my end it end experience with City fibre has been great
Great service kept upto date with installation instructions and delivery of goods  rang ahead of the installation and kept informed one of engineers explained how to download the app 
Arrived at time they said installed quickly and all working well
Arrived on time and were very pleasant
Communication was good though out kept you updated with the progress
Installers were helpful and tidied up
Excellent service Engineers were polite and professional Job done in one morning shift Broadband was up and running Highly recommend
Shortly after Christmas I had full fibre installed into my home The engineers from Kelly were sent out to do installations at the time I didnt know they were subcontracted by Cityfibre The inside work was good however I asked them for a discrete solution outside and they suggested digging a strip down my drive to hide the cable As they were the engineers I just trusted them that the solution would work and would look discrete as possible Shortly after the installation they found out there was a blockage and the line would need to be fixed by another teamTwo weeks later the actual Cityfibre team came out and said that regardless of where the blockage was they would redo the install as there was a trip hazard where a cable was entering into the tarmac and the tarmac which Kelly put down was not done neatly and the path they chose was the most complicated and could cause problems in the future Myself being a customer trusted the Kelly engineers to do the installation that is best and tell me if there was anything which would not be ideal or not possible however their lack of experience and haste ended up with the Kelly and Cityfibre Peterborough managers being sent out to redo the installation and unblock the line After the Cityfibre engineers came out the next day they sent out four Kelly vans and two Cityfibre vans over the course of the day to get the installation up and running In the morning the Kelly manager came through and apologised that the install would need to be redone and explained some options Near the end of the job the main Cityfibre engineer I spoke to that pointed out the problems with the installation was excellent and I felt that he took responsibility for making sure the job was done correctly he came back and wired up the house with the cables and did all the wire work on the brown and green boxes outside the house for the reinstall and was very professional and knowledgeable and I appreciated his updates and honesty throughout After 4 hours the house was finally up and running and after a few days plugged in I am getting speeds of around 700900mbps and 60200mbps over WiFi Even though the experience wasnt ideal I appreciate that Kelly and Cityfibre did everything they could to make it right from clearing the blockage and redoing the house installation and the redoing the tarmac to make it sit more flush If they did the install correctly the first time it would have saved myself alot of time waiting and my driveway and Kelly and Cityfibre alot of time an resources aswell as they effectively did 3 installations worth of work trying to do the installation to the optimal standard I was disappointed that my drive was dug up for no reason however when they redid the tarmac atleast it was looking a bit neater however more work will be required to get the whole driveway to blend in together and the strip they dug out to be less noticeable Alot of time and investment will be required to jet wash down the drive and repaint over the whole drive with special paint to blend in the darker strip of tarmac which Kelly Services dug out I would advise that if you are uneasy about any aspect of the install if a white Kelly van turns up ask them if you can speak to Cityfibre directly for their opinion before they do anything The experience and knowledge of the actual Cityfibre engineers is ofcourse much higher than the Kelly engineers and I can sense there are frustrations with Kelly doing installs which are not optimal or upsetting alot of customers All the people I spoke to from Cityfibre were very understanding and wanted to make sure the install and the service was delivered to the best standard possible which I am grateful for and after 7 weeks from my order with Vodafone finally we have fibre broadband in our home
I am currently maintaining a diary of my ongoing attempts to get my new full fibre internet and VOIP from City Fibre and Air Broadband working properly I will post a full review if and when this saga ever ends Quick summary don’t believe the hype If I could give this zero stars I would As I write this we are yet again totally without broadband and telephoneIf you are still tempted and need VOIP my advice would be to wait until City Fibre’s current exclusive agreement with Air Broadband has ended and see if Zen Broadband is any better
After the installation  I have been left with a trip hazard on my foot path The installation was completed in the dark  So I guess this isnt the installers fault This does need sorting out as the cable is exposed on my foot path
Put fibre on one side of the street  Whose brilliant idea was it to omit the other side  the one we live on I wonder how many potential customers go begging because of CityFibre’s incompetenceReply is standard corporate twaddle Had they bothered to read the review they would’ve realised it can’t be a private road because the other side is already “fibred” And no it’s not a multi occupant building it’s a detached house And cable laying has been and gone see above And the cable did cross the road at the junction 30 yards from our house just didn’t bother to turn back along the pavement on our side Oh for the efficiency of the private sector  Wait a minute …
Appalling customer service They tried to connect the fibre from pavement to the house but couldnt because of the location of the connector on the pavement that they installed They have so far refused to send a team to move the connection on the pavement I raised a complaint with the ISP but CityFibre wont respond to that either
Installation engineers polite efficient patient Discussed my options for where to install it and were professional Whilst also be kind and understanding of my health mobility issues and disabilities Brilliant
I can not believe a communication company can be so poor at communicatingIt took 4 appointments 8am to 1pm  to get my connection completed1st time no one turned up or contacted me2nd time no one turned up I contacted vodaphone told may be behind still comming They didnt turn up or contact me3rd time no one arived until 140 then did not know how to connect tried to lay a new fibre I already had fibre told me I would have to cut wires if I wanted old box removing NO Could not find how to connect said road needing digging up left No Internet or phone line 4th time I recieved a call at 1230 told engineers  equipment not working 4 people before me may may not arrive that day I said I was out a 1pm would reschedule245 call from engineer at my house I returned home all work completed in 1 hour no new cable needed their unit in old box finaly job completed tidy clean polite But I should not have had to waste 4 days waiting when a call or text to keep me informed should have been easy They Need to look at how AOcom keep customers constantly informed
Avoid this company just moved to a new property in York and took out a 24 month Vodafone full fibre contract as affiliated with City fibreAfter a two week wait the city fibre engineers turned up today and informed me full fibre was actually not currently available at my address as the civils work hasnt been completed yet They didnt have a date of when it would be doneI work from home and this Id a significant impact to my family There was no mitigation in place and Ive been left with no Internet and no information  its ridiculous
After a now ex neighbour going with Vodaphone and having broadband installed by Cityfibre im still waiting on at least a courtesy notification to say that the intention is to site unsightly wires and casing around my groundfloor flats bedroom windows to top floor flat  which have become dislodged and are now dangling  I have repeatedly tried to engage both with Vodaphone  who pass the buck and to cityfibre who have not been interested whatsoever in resolving this in a satisfactory manner  my calls have been ignored by a city fibre manager after he had arranged to come to my flat and view the shoddy workmanship himself and to discuss resiting of the cables in a more discrete way which he then failed to show up  This has been going on for months and im incensed frustrated and close to  bursting with the insulting and unprofessional way this matter has been handled  Absolute nightmare what does a person have to do to get this resolved once and for all Renfrew based and owner of said flat here
A very friendly and professional service for my install by Tim and Matt thank you very much 👍🏽😊
I have had 5 appointment dates since September including today Yet again noone has bothered to turn up or contact me I even received text messages yesterday asking me to confirm that I will be home
Just had my installation today they was very helpful and did a good job Thanks you Julius and Aidan for the amazing installation and information when I asked questions
Mo  Joe  the engineers explained the installation process and worked to meet customers preferences They made a neat and tidy job of the installation One of the best installations we have experienced I should know as a former electrical installer myselfMaking the customers happy is not always the easiest thing to achieve
The 2 guys that came out were brilliant  They were very friendly polite and professional They even put up with my big barking dog and my chatty curious daughter that kept asking them questions and throwing her ball at them The WiFi seems to be the best I’ve had my partner was very impressed when it came to download speeds on his PlayStation 🙄 my 11 year old is also very happy with it 
You missed 2 appointments which I had to take 2 days of work for then turned up on the 3rd appointment  We had the talktalk ufo box instslled the engineer didnt have a clue what to do with it Told us that it had to stay because it was running the telephone line  but this is dead no ring tone He openly admitted he didnt have a clue about the phonesThey put a small black box  near to the original box  with a small  fiber optic  running between then this is unprotected from damage We were told by the installer we had to keep both power supplys plugged in  On inspection by myself I found that the power supply  to the white box original was to a battery backup not powering anything because he had taken the port out and disconnected the phone cable In my opinion the installer hadnt a clue about the older systems  Very poor service as a result of the missed appointments in seriously out of pocket as I had to refuse work  £50000  loss of earnings because you couldnt keep to appointment or be bothered to inform me you werent coming on all occasions Shocking service Got a reply asking to send info to an email address  I have done this several times No one ever replies to the emails  a total waste of time Shower of sh
The engineers were great It was a shame that it took four appointments to get them to attend and do the work
The engineers were thoughtful and considerate very helpful Cleaned up and left the property as good as when they came Quick service
Excellent service highlihy recommended Engineers were polite professional and efficient Very happy with speed of Internet
Worst decision ever to go with city fibre 3rd month with no Internetthe issue isnt with Vodafone we have a problem with the main box and cityfibre just dont take any actionmy property was damaged in the process of them installing the cable  had to attend twice because the first time the engineers didnt know what they were doing they installed it wrong with live wires showing I should have seen the warning signals then
Good communication friendly and good standard of work
worst service ever dealt with any broadband provider  keep sending leaflets to my house  that gigabyte service available now  When opted  waited for weeks and weeks without any broadband  They kept telling  to Vodafone that our engineers busy and will sort it out Nobody came As per Vodafone needed digging and further connection  to be sorted by city fibre Few other neighbours had same issue  I will not recommend this company to anyone When you call or email city fibre they reply we dont deal with customers directly please contact vodfone or your provider 
Great communication tidy polite efficient installers and the speed On full fibre 900 Amazing  I recommend CityFibre full fibre network much better than my previous supplier via cable
City fibre installed in June 22 to property due to poor work had to re do the work Since then I have tried to get connected I had cancelled with my previous copper line broadband and moved to Vodafone in Nov City fibre keep advising Vidafone they will resolve the connection every week since Its now Jan 23 and have been given a further week again for resolution but no one ever comes out No one at cityfibre actually cares as the whole street have no fibre connection Looking to call Cityfibre and ask them remove fibre installation from my property and go back to copper phone lines Ive currently been using my mobile phone hotspot usage since November 22 with kids in house tou can imagine the chaos
Prompt and quick with service clean and tidy Great service provided
Absolutely shocking Came today and said they needed to dig up my £8000 driveway and smash up bricks outside my house to fit the fibre No mention of this and they couldn’t repair my driveway to the same as it was because they don’t use the same tarmac Never heard of anything so stupid Waste of time Now got to try to sort it all out by getting my old provider to reconnect me Joke of a company with no thought process The engineers that arrived had said they’ve come across this most of the time Spent all this money digging up the roads and causing chaos for months for them to have the dig up peoples driveways and houses just for better broadband What an absolute mess If I could give Zero stars I would
The engineers where very polite cheerful explained what they where going to do  They cleaned up after themselves and would highly recommend them 
This guys were amazing  and very helpful very happy with a service
The work was carried out with excellent efficiency speed and cleanliness
Engineers were clear efficient and tidy
All good quick install
Julius and Aidan did a fast and efficient job of fitting my full fibre internet and also helped me set up the internet router to get me connected
Constantly getting spam mail from them Ive repeatedly asked for the letters to stop as I wont use this service Yet it hasnt stopped Pretty sure thats frowned upon also
Amazing Turned up first thing and whilst I went out to drop off the kids to school they’d done what they needed to externally It took them about 25 mins to get everything set up Internet working really fast What a great bunch of guys very professional and efficient
Router installed to wrong part of houseRouter was installed onto a bed Causing a fire hazard install denied use of bed Routerconnection didn’t workInstallers comment ‘not our problem talk to your service provider’Emailed city fibre as advised below I Have been blocked
Quick clean and great experience throughout
Waited in all day and engineer didn’t come booked a second appointment and received confirmation I phoned my provider the morning before just to double check an engineer was definitely coming only to find out there wasn’t even an appointment
The engineer was very polite and explained everything very wellperfect thankyou
Easy quick and no mess
Prompt efficient flexible and sensitive to my installation preferences
The city fibre contractor worked effientantlly and quick Wore a protective mask Clean workmanship Good manners
Was a quick an efficient job
City Fibre are installing outside my house Their workmen damaged my Virgin Media cable and disconnected my phone and broadband then went home without notifying anyone Liaising with City Fibre is a complete nightmare Apparently because it is not their cable they cannot mend it fair enough Apparently they also bear no responsibility for arranging the repair my job arent liable for any compensation Virgins job and wont help in any way  Totally washed their hands of their own damage Having read other reviews I see they have behaved similarly when their workmen damaged an electric cable Really poor all round And Virgin are equally rubbish  will come out and look at it in 7 daysAvoid avoid avoid
Really quick pleasant installers Thanks Tim take care
Julius and Aiden were very professional and set the connection up ver well
Ive been on CityFibre via Zen for several months now and Ive never known so many complete outages in all my years online with various ISPsCityFibre regularly seem to take down entire sections of their network overnight which often results in the fibre not coming back up correctly the following morning There was an outage last night and I see from Zens site that there are two more planned within the next week Neither Zen nor CityFibre give any advance alert that there will be outages apparently were expected to check the planned maintenance page daily just in case there might be an outage happening  why can they not just email customers to let them know in advance Im frequently in the middle of streaming something when it suddenly stops  only for me to realise the connection has gone off AGAINIt seems that CityFibre do not have any redundancy built into their network if it requires the whole thing be turned off and on again to do any work or updates  The outages are frequently several hours overnight and an issue this causes is that so many smart devices such as home lighting require an active connection to function  meaning I cant even turn off lights and go to bedIve ended up buying a 4G dongle and data SIM to provide connectivity which is a ridiculous thing to have to doI cannot wait until Openreach finally get their fibre to the area locally as Id switch away from CityFibre in a heartbeat based on the repeated frustrations with dropped connectivityThe speeds are great  the reliability is terribleEdit replying to CityFibres reply  not much Zen can do if youve turned off chunks of the network from underneath them
Agreed to an appointment for a free fibre upgrade on behalf of Talktalk I confirmed twice with them that an adult would be in between 13001800 to allow access Waited in and no engineer arrived No phone calltext or email received to let me know of non arrival Afternoon totally wasted Then have the cheek to try and get me to rebook the appointment
Was asked where Id prefer the placement of wires and router and was talked through the work needing done in the garden and my outside wall Whole process was stress free and didnt take to long Box placement right next to the sockets is nice and level so lools good aswel Guys were brand new aswel
Julias and Adrian were very professional in there work On time very quick and tidy Everything was explained from start to finish They are a credit to there work
Arrived on time and we’re very helpful and friendly Demitri and vlad  did a good job
The super understanding and very careful engineer I Recommend
Installed fttp Very polite and professional
Excellent customer service from the engineers which visited my property
City Fibre were very accommodating in our requests on where we preferred the cable to enter They took it around the side of our house through an surrounding wall under our front garden under 2 heavy slabs and through the garage wall They did a great job of tidying up after all that Ive now gone from 70mb line to 500mb which all really really worth it
Thank you so much Alex and Scott from city fibre  You guys worked very well install the cable not a problem Few people can’t install the cable  Great work done ✅From Mr singh
Excellent service many thanks Appreciate
Engineer turned up lateno phone call or text to say he would be No apology  and left us with no Internet we had to get in touch with Vodafone to get up and running
Engineers arrived well within the agreed time slot Cable routing and placement of equipment was discussed prior to the install and my input was taken into account for the final routing Polite at all times and efficient the install was quick tidy and checked to ensure that the line and my equipment was working as expected I am Very happy with the service given If this is representative of the in use service to come I will be very satisfied Given my experience so far I would definitely recommend cityfibre
This company installed fibre optic cable in the small close in which I live In doing so my mains electric supply was damaged leaving me with flashing lights and appliances I was informed by the electric company  that to cover up the damage a bag of postcrete was tipped into the excavation to cover the damageThis resulted in total loss of power on 18th December and I am still on a temporary connection over three weeks laterToday they contacted me to link to their fibre optic supply You can guess my response
Tyler and Al turned up on time and the install was perfect The weather was terrible and both guys were thoroughly soaked Great work in bad weather
No problem with install nice men well mannered and all cleaned up took about an hour
Great price quick installation fastest ever internet speeds to offer Virgin Media have a lot of catching up to do if O ever go back to them
The installation engineers arrived as scheduled and the whole installation was complete and working in little over an hour  Before starting work they explained all they needed to do and discussed where the service would enter the property
Complicated installation process which resulted in different CityFibre teams criticising each others’ work  Still don’t seem to be getting the speeds I expect with ISP Brillband providing poor supportAlso serious lack of ISP choice  only 6 providers available via CityFibre which really restricts choice  Most of the main providers aren’t available
Politequick efficient The engineer and I discussed best place and then completed install quick and cleanly
So well organised swift clean and professional
Just had FTTP 900 Installed and so far it’s been great The install was quick just like my internet Very happy
Very friendly and knowledgeable clean and tidy team of guys fitted the  fibre yesterday all works brilliantly
Great installation team quick neat A
I made the mistake of switching from Vodafone to Giganet because it was cheaper and have been without an internet connection for 7 weeks now1 weeks into my 4 week cancellation period with Vodafone CityFibre disconnected my line and I had no internet for 3 weeks I was told this would be resolved when I switched to the new provider on the 8th December Here we are 9th January still no internetBoth Vodafone and Giganet said its a problem with CityFibre and despite many emails to giganet they just say we are chasing this with CityFibreIt was fine before I switched well occasionally sub 50mb speed on a 900mb connection but I dont know if that was CityFibre or VodafoneThe process clearly isnt there for switching provider The whole thing is a mess and left me without an internet connection for 7 weeks so far If its still not resolved in a week I need an internet connection for work and my phone data is unreliable and expensive Ill just be going back to 60mb over the phone line until OpenReach or any other more competent FTTP provider is available at my property
Had an install booked for 13the december engineer attended but could not connect due to it being dark and needling to use a ladder Fine I had to call my provider 5 times to arrange another appointment since with promised callbacks not followed throughEventually I managed to rebook with my provider almost a month later  today Jan 9th and then had the engineer call me because they have been divered to another customers emergency and thus would not attend until after 7pm and therefore not be able to install again becuause it is darkWhy are you assinging jobs at 6PM or later in the UK in winter You can check the sunset time and avoid wasting everyones time I will be cancelling this new install and recommending that no one waste their time with your useless company since you will just mess us about and waste days at home waiting for nothing Why does an emergency take precidence over prebooked appointments Unacceptable
Polite and explained everything they were going to do before they done it and cleaned up afterwards
One of the Engineers have damaged the brick wall and they struggled to install the cable due to flat roof in the front which leads to the room it required installing I have taken photos and would like one of City Fibres customer service agent to resolve the issue at hand
Friendly engineers was kept up to by text and calls about my installation appointment and the Internet works great Cant complain about it
The engineers were so helpful Answered all my questions  friendly Faultless Amazing experience
2 gents Danny and Louis were fab Extremely polite very friendly and were able to answer all my queries and put us on easeAppreciate the 2 guys coming out they were fantastic and definitely deserve appraisal for their work and customer service and carThanks guys
Complete lack of customer focus The installation had to be rescheduled three times as the engineer just didnt show up with no communication whatsoever Everyone who I spoke to when trying to understand why nobody came was blaming some other companies and that they have no influence over the installation team I dont care what contractors you are using after all they are working under your name so I am sure you have some influence over the team and if not why do you use them In any case a simple call would be appreciated that the installation would not happen on the day due to some reasons so I dont waste my time and take a day off work waiting for the installation which is not going to happen
Fibre installed about 1 month ago Stopped working Im currently waiting over 1 week for even an answer that an engineer can attend via Talk Talk and City Fibre The lack of communication information and customer services is appalling  If you have the chance to avoid using City Fibre I would recommend this route
I received a letter in the post recommending me to upgrade to the new network Im already connected to one of the providers recommended and under the question Im still connected to one of the providers the answer is no problem What does that mean Theres no other help throughout their site and it looks like Im being encouraged to upgrade to something i dont really need Therefore in light of scams so riddled  in the press Ive given 1 star for lack of communication they are a communication company after all
The whole thing installed in less than 1 hour very professional
Excellent service very professional team off engineers highly recommended
Good communications between myself and provider
Installation crew were great Put fibre media converter exactly where I wanted it even although it was not straight forward
Tim and Mat were so helpful and professional  They redid a shoddy job one 2 other contractors from City fibre had done They also explained how the transfer over to cable would happen  Many thanks
Great jobBeen provided with all the information Professional and quick installation 
The engineers listened to what I wanted them to do then fitted their equipment where Id asked Tidied up before they left Checked the new fibre connection was working All good
Cityfibre Glasgow and build partners do not clean up after the work is done Mud and stones have gathered outside my house and streetWhat a mess Drainsgullies cleared last year are as bad as ever They damaged drains on the street A blocked drain backed up to a neighbours toilet and caused considerable damage Piles of rubble and fencing lay about for a few weeks The pavements are a mess thanks to the poor work of Cityfibre and build partners Matter reported to Councillor and Cityfibre before Christmas Awaiting a reply Shocking consideration for public safety and propertyBEWARE CITYFIBRE IN YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD Considerate contractors no chance I wont be touching their fibre if thats how they operate
Didnt complete the installation missed two dates after that leaving us with no broadband for 3 days and counting
CityFibre installed 1gb internet at my home recently Took about 2 hours They spent time going through installation where best to install the boxes and hiding the cable as much as possible The team were very customer focused and made sure I was happy with everything Would recommend the team who installed for me Very happy with the service and the internet is super fast Getting full async line speed
Great guys left the place as the found it  Explained everything well
We arranged broadband through vodafone City fibre were the company who were installing the fibre from the box to the house Three times they cancelled Constantly turning up without making appointments and when we were not in cancelled the install Complete lack of customer service from them
had city fibre installed on 23of dec 22 it is still  not working the guy did a good job installing but said they could not connect so no fibre i am still on broadband nobody checked the problem yet although they know
Julius and Aiden came to do the the installation and came to get the job done which is what I wanted They offered different routes for the wife to be places as being a large house the WiFi needs to be in an optimum place knowing that julius did great in communicating and was helpful to know where to place the router Aiden did the work from the outside was quick and efficient These 2 engineers did a great job and left with everything back in its place
Great fibre broadband and friendly installation engineer
Yusef and Darren not sure of the second name installed the fibre line to our house They were quick friendly and tidy
Had my city fibre installed by Dimitri and Val and everything went smoothly and they were very helpful and informative about the all processOverall a very good and pleasant experience
Gav and Lewis done a wonderful job installing our Internet Very polite and pleasant pair They done a very neat and tidy job Wish all engineers where like themThank you so much
Excellent communication before service getting in touch when nearby my property and explained what they were going to do at my property Very professional and friendly Thank you
Engineers jake and jayden were quick and efficient at setting up my Internet and showed me everything that theyd done and didnt leave any mess very pleased with this thank you
Informative and charismatic duo of engineers cool at doing their jobs attentive to details they are good listeners I enjoy their job although brief but intelligent I will recommend Julius and Eden anytime
Quick and efficient
Very efficient  and and informative  would  recommend
Jake and Jayden were really personable and installed my fibre with no fuss or hassle Would definitely recommend
The installing engineers were excellent at trying to fit in with my needs
Dimitri and Vlad called before arrival which was very useful as we were on school run so that helped They arrived and explained everything they were going to do and very efficient service
Clean quick and respectful
Installers contacted me in the morning of work commencing they arrived and explained fully what they were going to do and proceeded with the installation all in all they were courteous friendly and very professional and I can find no fault with anything during and after work was completed
Very happy with the engineers who were helpful and pleasant It would be helpful to homeowners if the engineers had shoe covers to protect light colour flooring as do other engineers It would then be 5 stars
Joe Sam and Adam did a fantastically quick and clean job of installing my full fibre to the house on behalf of City fibre They were very professional polite and more than happy to talk me and my neighbour through everything before and as they did the work I would have no hesitation in recommending themCity fibre
Friendly helpful
Plenty of updates on how things would proceed  Install as we asked for and installed within an hour
Demitri and his coworker arrived early and were very efficient The fibre had to be laid under the block paving in my driveway and they left it looking exactly as it was originally They explained how all the equipment worked and were very polite Excellent service
Lads that came to install my Internet today were great didnt take them long and super friendly and professional after having my install dropped on them at last minute at the end of the day 
waited in again for install  engineers didnt turn up what a surprise cannot trust this shower to keep any appointment  please keep away from this fibre company you will have nothing but trouble
I read a lot of bad reviews on Facebook about city fibre plus Vodafone told me sometimes they leave without internet working so asked the installers about the whole process when they arrived the installation went well  internet was working straight away  no damage to my property
Updated Since being connected all was fine for a couple of days then sadly we’ve had bad connection since Nothing in my daughters bedroom  lose wifi frequently in the living room… right next to the router Not happy Got connected to Talk Talk today by City Fibre Dominic called before he arrived to let me know he was en route Very nice lad He explained the process and him  his colleague got to work straight away He made sure everything was in working order before signing the job off Excellent service Thanks Dominic
The installers for our fibre broadband came when they said they would listened and worked out the best route and position of the wires and router for us then carried out the work efficiently and left everything tidy and in the state they found it Very polite and helpful installers
Just had great experience with them fitting are WiFi in was only here an hour and all perfect no mess was two very kind gentleman that just got on with what they needed to do I’m very pleased with it all x
Engineer left without testing if devices could connect They couldnt and a cityfibre werent interested when I calledpassed the buck even though they had not completed the job connecting us to fibre broadband It later proved to be their mistake
Took 3 appointments to complete first 2 appointments waited in 5 hours each time on 1st visit said couldnt do anything as cable in box not connected 2nd visit told me gun that shoots cable down case not working and couldn’t do anything Got them to do inside bit at least but that was not done correctly 3rd visit from another team all went well they had to redo inside bit as well as not done correctly 3rd team was good and professional
Makesure the engineer wears shoes coverings or removes shoes Muddy all my carpets Moved my bins which made rubbish fall on the floor and was just left Very unprofessional service
Nice service A
Called beforehand to tell me what time they would arrive On arrival explained what they were going to do and asked me where I wanted the box fitted Bit noisy but not too bothersome Engineer was polite and courteous at all times Highly recommend
Engineers were not interested in doing any other install other than drilling straight through our wall which would not work in our house and be much more disruptive than running cables under our basement Mess was not cleared away from any ur basement and left with no working internet and engineers informed it’s not their job to do checks before leaving Engineers were unable to answer any  technical questions regarding the install and equipment being used It would be useful if the engineers could answer basic technical questions and offer advice on the service being installed
Ordered FTTP from Vodafone 2 gentleman from city fibre came to connect us today and were really helpful and professional made minimal disturbance to our garden when laying the tube for the fibreoptic lead and were finished in under 2 hours including getting us connected If you are in the Lowestoft area I would highly recommend city fibre
I got my brand new and amazingly fast internet from Cityfibre in no time 1 week from order to completion Very happy with the service so far
Exceptional service called before arriving Explained what would happen installed with no issues and cleaned up
Excellent quick service
Installation was really quick  tidy  the timing was confirmed in advance which was reassuring The engineers explained on the day what the work would entail  discussed with me the best way to do it
Difficult installation but all done and all left clean
Easy to deal with and accomodating They were quick doing the work when here and friendly and polite
There was an issue when blowing through the fibre from the cabinet and I was told that it could take 5 days to resolve However a City Fibre engineer arrived an hour later and resolved the problem almost immediately The original installers then returned to finish the job I expected to have to wait another week or two for the installation to be completed once the original installers left but they managed it in just a few hours The installers and engineers were polite and informative I could not have asked for better service
The engineers were competent and fast doing their job They explained what they were going to do in a very clear way The network is working very good now and all my family is happy
Brilliant job by the engineers Took great care in running the external cable almost invisibly around the building
The 2 lads what came did a great job in my property thank you too them
Brilliant job with superb broadband Very happy to join Nextgeneration Internet
Shocking experience with City Fibre I really did not expect this poor quality of service Twice now the installation engineers have failed to attend a booked installation visit at my property without any communication or explanation I rang switchboard at City Fibre and they just told me to get in touch with my internet provider who are not to blame and are frustrated themselves with this shambles from City Fibre Each time the visit has been booked with a confirmation text message received I have had to rearrange work to be at home and they are just wasting people’s time by not even bothering to turn up to the appointment Once can be understood but twice is just a joke It seems I’m not the only one experiencing this issue from reading other people’s reviews
Really nice person and good work I m very happy thank you
Lovely service people Martin and Erin done job in 20 mins best service Happy new year
A prompt and clean delivery of service with no fuss  The engineers that arrived were polite professional and very knowledgeable
Had my installation for Zen Internet via CityFibre this morning Got a call when they were 5 mins away and the whole thing took about an hour to do Julius  Aiden were brilliant Talked through and explained everything clearly Spot on Great job
Don’t bother if you actually want internet I moved home and was told by my supplier that cityfibre own the infrastructure in the new area and I would need to have an engineer come to connect us up I booked this 3 weeks in advance for a seamless transition into the new home We rushed around on move day so that we could be there ready for the engineer We then waited in for 5 hours for them not to show up No curtesy call and no reason given when I called to rebook Waited in for another 5 hours a week later and again no show and no reason given I rang up and was told I was now a priority as two appointments had been missed and that an engineer would be round that afternoon So I ended up waiting in all day and Guess what another no show No curtesy call to say why I was missed I lodged an official complaint on that day and was told someone would get back to me in 3 days with a solution I am now 12 days without internet with a wife that runs an online business and I have still not had a response to my complaint 3 days later These guys treat you like a mug seriously don’t bother
Only came on the third appointment and then very late in the evening The cable to the property is exposed and laid so shallow that the cable is above the old virgin cable which was also shallow Overall not a good experience
Damaged brick where they drilled from outsidestill waiting on an answer to replace the brick
Good communication and quick and efficient install Pleased with how hassle free its been
The engineers were very friendly nothing was too much trouble and they made sure to explain everything as they went along
They were really polite and made as little mess as possible updated me on what they were doing at all time and got it done fast
I had the installation done on Friday 30th December and I’m still not online I’ve been phoning up about it and they originally didn’t seem to know what had gone wrong I phoned again and they said it’ll take 48hrs to go active that didn’t happen so I phone again today and they’ve now said it’ll take 3 to 5 working days Talktalk also kept putting me on hold which was annoying
Install was done quickly at the location request and we’ll communicated
The engineers were good but the Internet service is poor
Good communication efficient and polite staff
Both technicians Chris Watters and Andy Walker were first class They were very friendly and patient throughout the whole process Due to the building structure it wasn’t a straight forward install but they were both great
Dimitry and Vlad were great hence the four star review Thanks
Julius and aiden were very professional and fast
Had home broadband installed with zero fuss Time scale given was 8am and they were here on the dot ready to begin Neat and tidy install with full explanation on how to set up the services Thanks to Scott and Alex for the fantastic job would highly recommend using them Thanks again
Good communication and service Work done quick with no problems while talking us through the process Cleaned up after themselves too
Installers great Job done quickly on scheduled date
Booking online was so easy and efficient Price and offers were most competitive And company kept me informed all through purchasing process to installation
Found the installation and service quick and efficient
Amy and Damien were fast and efficient getting the work done that was needed the kept the work space clean and tidy and tidied up after they had finished no mess was left they were polite and explained everything perfectly
Great job Great service 👏
Everything was perfect
First ordered with TalkTalk to upgrade with CityFibre at my address in July of this year which stalled on CityFibres end and seemed to drag on and on with multiple new orders needing to be made due to a mishap with the street install for my property a flat in a converted townhouse only one connection was provided for three flats After going to two additional providers Vodafone Zen due to issues with TalkTalk disconnecting my old line early finally got a definitive answer that due to being the attic flat CityFibre cannot install due to it needing to be internally wired despite multiple other properties on the street having a similar situation to mine in terms of height Unfortunately you cant avoid them as they own the cables in the street so Im having to go back to the old fibre phoneline connection I had previously now on a worse contract than I was with TalkTalk previously Cheers for that CityFibre
Good job and very efficient
Demitri and Vlad came to do our internet upgrade and did a very good job
Installation guys Dave and Mike very helpful and very quick Excellent work
Good experience in installing full fibre to the house Stefan and Martin arrived punctually worked quickly in very poor weather to install the cable and boxes and left everything tidy at the end Everything was explained as the work progressed
Jay  Chris very professional in explaining in detail as to what will happen and carried out the work in a professional and timely manner Please convey this to themHowever gets them to install in their home will be very very pleased indeedHappy new year to them and their company
Very good service  Fantastic comunication Talk Talk the best
Everything went as planned  very good 
Excellent engineers Very courteous Did a tidy installation of fiber optics cables in the house
Great and professional work from Dimitri and Vlad 1010 no problem at all
The new Fibre cable installation went well with minimal disruption The communication was spot on the gentlemen were professional and did their job promptly
Cityfibre started putting fibre in our area back in early 2021 we started receiving flyers as well as email confirming that we could place our orders In March 2022 order 1 was placed with company x after 3 months no engineer visit and order was cancelled December 2022 order 2 was placed with company y no engineer visits and order was cancelled If a block of flats arent fibre ready why are you writing to us and allowing suppliers to accept orders to then cancel without notice and waste everyones time This is false advertising and you should correct your site to reflect who can actually order Get your engineers to Ferry Village in Renfrew to actually figure out 1 who can order 2 correct your site to reflect that 3 get whatever is needed in place so others can benefit from the service you provideEdit To all customer  CityFibre is not part of automatic compensation scheme under ofcom which is why you are seeing so many negative reviews on engineers not showing up appointmentorders getting cancelled and not providing the service they promiseUpdate 20 days since contacting feedbacktp and I havent even received acknowledgement email
Engineer and the workers were friendly and polite and got the job done pretty quickly Was a bit disappointed by the 6 hour window for visit and not being told a time slot meant I had to stay home all afternoon
Engineer was polite and friendly also very helpful with advice Im very happy with the service I receive from talk talk
Damaged my brick wall with extra hole in it filled it with silicone which looks disgusting Dont even tel me that they made that hole Also left me with non running fiber Didnt explain what have to be done to get it running Didnt clean up after installation left rubbish around house
City fibre  vodaphone installed full fibre in the bournemouth area but never have I ever had such shoddy unreliable customer service and having read other reviews there seem to be mostly unhappy customers They’ve moved the installation date twice at less than 24 hours notice via text message Me having taken time off work Then bombarded my partner with texts saying if we are not in when the engineer comes we will incour charges I’m shocked at the lack of humans to talk to  Just a robot chat that keeps you waiting for ages Trust pilot must have an inaccurate score judging by all the fuming customers still waiting for connection on social media …cont… Guess what There was a no show on the date moved to on the 28th so my partner and I had to ask Vodafone bot chat where the engineer was having waited all day AGAIN Anyway considering that Vodafone and City fibre are supposed to be big communication companies … They have no communication skills whatsoever We’ve now cancelled the third installation date given in January as frankly why should we wait in again take time off work for a no show and be told that if we miss the engineer we will be fined 🤣 Think Vodafone are short of decent customer support and subcontractors especially in the Bournemouth areaAnyway after cancelling we still had a text from BT today saying we were due to have our broadband switched off as we were leaving them  Terrible customer service for new business…
I gave a 1 review last week after they failed to turn up and never got in touchRescheduled for yesterday They turned up After 3 hours they asked if I had any allen keys they could borrow to sort something out I lent them some but it didnt work No problem they said well come back first thing the following morning to fix it They didnt appear No communication Left in limbo as to whenhow my internet will change
Waited in all day long for installation with nobody showing up Called myself to chase and told that there is a shortage of engineers in the area and to reschedule Reading all the other reviews about no shows and installation issues I am not looking forward to this Will update if these clowns ever manage to install my Internet Very lucky to still have BT for another 2 weeks in the cancellation periodUpdate 301222 I called up to rearrange and they said they have a huge shortage of engineers and been getting calls all day every day this week from customers with no shows and no communication She advised to rebook for end of January to be sure of a successful installation I cant wait that long but have gone mid month with January 10th Then 4 hours later I get a text saying my engineer is booked in for 31st December and I am not in tomorrow I call City Fibre who said now it is with the engineer they cant reschedule it until the engineer rejects it so I have to call back on January 3rd to rebook installation and have also lost my January 10th booking Utter incompetenceUpdate 090123 Engineers came out nice lads all installed without issue but paraphrasing here the original City Fibre engineers have not tested the fibre before recovering all the pavements and when they try to pull it through there is a blockage which would have been known if it was tested Needs another team to come out dig up the pavement and allow me and anybody else to have fibre installed Brilliant Lets see how many weeks this takes
Original install booked via Vodafone October 2021 1st order eventually cancelled February 2022 after 5 no show appointments for engineer visits with no calls or notice they wouldnt be there out of frustration After a year and still no competing service in my area begrudgingly placed a new order scheduled for October 2022 this was rescheduled for November then December the 15th by vodafone engineers turned up this time great only had tools to do half the job not so greatArranged second visit for today the 29th no show in the morning phone cityfibre and get told it will be an hour 3 hours later no show and no word call back cityfibre and get told i have to speak to vodafone as cityfibre cant help me despite them being the ones responsible for the installUtter shambles of a company 7 scheduled visits 6 no shows and days wasted and 1 job half done
The installation went well The engineers very friendly and kept us informed throughout Would highly recommend
quick clean and neatjust wish it had been working before he left but not sure that was down to city fibre or talk talk
Guys did an excellent professional job
The guys that did the installation were polite efficient and tidy
Good service Fast connectivity
Following instructions No issues at all
Great quick service The lads names below were superb and well informed
Great efficient service from Dimitri and Vlad
Engineer friendly and even left us with a free router Unfortunately its for the wrong provider but that isnt CFs fault
Chris the installer was very politeinformative and professional The workmanship was perfect well done City Fibre
Has Dallas  Keith arrived today to install our new Vodaphone internet connection They were friendly respectful  professional at all times I was very grateful that they took the time to explain what they were doing to my elderly dad both inside  outside the house They were a pleasure to have here  I can wholeheartedly recommend them
It was all professionally done good service installed in time where I wanted and clean
Everything carried out very professionally  
Engineering team where very Pro and polite  Broadband fitted within 90 mins
The engineers that attended were really helpful and professional
The staff members that installed the equipment were incredibly friendly and explained everything fully so I understood everything and I am very grateful
Very well explained by engineers very quick installation and neat install  Internet worked immediately
They were really kind and helpful They had nice teamwork and just banter they did the job in a wiz
Engineers were great hard working and professional lads They got in and out in very lean time considering size of the job and were efficient and dedicated Would recommend the product team and service so far to anyone
waited in for 5 hours for the engineer to come an install the fibre for a no show what a joke
First class friendly professional
the engineer was very helpfuland explained to me what he was doingvery happy with the fibre broadbandvery good customer servicewould definitely recommend
thank you Dimitri and Vlad for your help you were very quick and did a great job
Mickey and Ibrahim did an excellent job with the minimum of upset
They were just nice people who came to my home
Great  Perfect
Turned up within the allotted time frame Explained what they were going to do and how and made sure I was ok with that Cleaned up after themselves and made sure everything was working before they left
Internet slow
This is amazing pac I will recommend if you want really good spread just find this package Thanks Vodafon
Experience was great  installation was quick
Their guys are great explain everything clean up after themselves and are very friendly and niceThe company kept us updated with texts regarding installationIt didnt take long at all
We joined city fibre via talktalk we are pensioners  engineers came today said they could not get cable stapled at side entrance as they could not get through  Husband suggested going through other passageway they said no with no explanation and left  As pensioners this put a lot of stress on us spent 2 hrs and had to get 4 weeks extension on existing contract never known such TERRIBLE service from a broadband company  what is the point of having full fibre when engineers do not survey first and try and resolve any issues  we may end up going back to our existing supplier  customers be warned city fibre promises a lot but does not deliver
Dave and Mike were dead nice lads Explained everything to us at each step and we’re no fuss at all
Polite friendly and professional No issues with installation Up and running within 20 minutes from start to finish
Again bad reviewI am waiting activation fron 26th NovemberThey sent me 2 enginers on 12th December that that broken the cable that connect inside the house to outside because they pulled so hard that the cable snappedThan they send another eniner to fix this cable on 20 of December that come without new cableI will be without connection untill 5th of jannuary 2023I am trying to contact them and thet only tell me i need call my provvider even if they are the only one that have cables here in this area
The engineers introduced themselves stated their different jobs and when each would be carrying their part out They were respectful and informed me of what was happening throughout their work
Would like to say a special mention to young lad ross who undertook work at my mothers house last month Extremely pleasant wasnt afraid to answer any questions and was the utmost professional A true credit to the company Working with a smile on your face is hard to come by these days but this boy done it flawlessly Anybody in edinburgh seeking cityfibre services please request ross you wont regret itHowever his work mate left a lot to be desired A little rude at times if im being perfectly honestAll round good experience Well done ross  cityfibre keep up the good work teamRobert
Good service no issues
Unaware that the landline was not working and also no internet
Overall Installation went all goodprofessional serviceHowever already having a cutouts and is not what promised at all 
Great service and communication Setting expectations and living up to them
Christmas EVe perserverenc to get job done Jack  Oli nice friendly installers
Originally supposed to have my line fitted on Wednesday nobody turned up and I was told Thursday Nobody turned up Thursday and I was told Friday morning Nobody turns up Friday morning but they are apparently going to come in the afternoon sometime A guy turns up at 3 says he can only do half of the work ONT and box outside because he has to get back for a hospital appointment Someone will be around to finish the job Saturday today Christmas eve Nobody here no texts nothing Ive spent 4 days in the house waiting for these clowns to do a simple job It doesnt bode well for any problems being fixed quickly in the futureUpdate 4th Jan  I was supposed to be connected yet again today but the installers didnt arrive until 4pm and they had apparently been lied to about the job and what needed doing running fibre from the pavement to the house As it was too dark they couldnt do it so I am now over 2 weeks past my installation date and still with no idea when Ill have it done It sounds like a manager called Adam surname withheld for now has been leading them up the garden path when it comes to what work they are being given and what information to give to the customer leading to a lot of annoyed people when they turn upUnfortunately I dont have a choice of fibre providers where I live currently but my advice would be to use someone else Virgin or Openreach if you have them It worries me that if my installation experience is so poor then what will getting any issues in the future sorted out quickly be likeUpdate 6th Jan finally installed after lots of noise and upsetting my neighbours but at least I have fibre now or do IJan 10th A different Cityfibre guy turns up to say hes here to run the fibre connection I explain it was done last week and he leavesJan 12th Listening to the radio on my Alexa at about 830am and it suddenly cuts off About 30 seconds later there is a knock at the door and there is another Cityfibre guy there who says hes here to run the fibre connection I tell him it was done last week he said no it wasnt so I say yes it was Ive been using it daily Oh he says before informing me that there is a break in the fibre when they had a look and they would have to blow a new bit down So they broke the fibre connection before checking with me Now Im here an hour later still with no internet and theyve driven away without telling me anything Utter Utter shambles of a firm
Good experience
The fact they left me without my landline
The Engineer was great  I was informed all through the process Good job
The lads that came to fit our WiFi was clean fast a and very help ful
Friendly and professional engineers A job well done in the quickest of times Highly recommended team
Good internet and quick clean job done no problem
Luke and Wayne today 23122022 have been and installed fibre broadband at our residence as per scheduled arrangement I find both of them quite genuinely diligent and friendly
Very impressed with the engineers who came out to install the full fibre explained what was going to happen and left garden and path as they found it
Max was a pleasant chap and talked me through the work he and the team were doing great service
very friendly professional service nothing to improve well done and thank you👍
Increase of broadband speed times 3Excellent service
The guys that came over Barry and Mark did a brilliant work They were very professional respectful and clean They complete the work in a record time and Im very happy with the result Definitely I would recommend Cityfibre
Quick and simple installationReally fast Internet Wasnt keen on them digging up the road when it was happening but well worth it now
The engineer was polite and efficiently carried out installation left
The internet provider just confirmed that the fault is from your installation hence i risk spending Christmas without internet They have reached out to you and this is yet to be resolvedI am not impressed
Very polite guys Very quick efficient and would definitely recommend
Second time lucky with the install… the process was a bit laborious but we got there in the end and now I’m getting 850mbit compared to my old BT line of 20mbit so overall I’m blown away by the service  Well done CityFibre
i had very bad experience with other engineers before they would not fit the router the room i wanted in from this company aidan and keenan engineers  came over fitted the router in my living room where i wanted without any problem they cleaned the mess after as well definitely recommend this company
The young lad was polite and helpful and nothing was too much trouble
Fantastic engineer very polite friendly and helpful
Everything ran smoothly and the team is amazing
Neil and his brother are both very respectful and get the job done Great guys Would highly recommend these guys
Lads done a great job even if they were from Bristol Cleaned up as well Spot on
John and Daniel were excellent service helped me through setting up my WiFi app as well
Have had them out 4 times in a month to install our full fibre   as our lounge is at the back and every time they wont drill or dig to run the cable tell you That you are responsible for that Finally had them do it now  Just in time for Christmas  at least Vodafone were more helpful in keeping us connected while waiting  for themand no contact email for feedback for them even after they replied
Pole man very accomplished with good communication skills Better at resolving loft conversion bungalow  issue than colleague
Efficient install and the team were greatUp and running with full fibre at great speed  very happy
AVOID if you can Received their email saying full fiber internet is available at my home Rang one of their partner GIGANET and got subscription Connection got installed on 28th November but no internet Called Giganet they say they are waiting for an update from Cityfiber Called cityfiber they said they are waiting for an update from their contractor No one ever visited at my property to check the faultPLEASE AVOID
The service is excellent Two friendly engineers Dimitri and other one came in for installation and done a fantastic job
Chris and Cameron amazing job friendly guys came in did the job fast and clean Would highly recommend
Mike and Dave came round to do the fibre install Did a great job very professional and friendly never left any mess at all
Well I just had the 2 best guys come over and install the router and cables and let me tell you they both are absolutely friendly and very informativeJulius and Aidan are the tops guys for the job…Great Job guys
On time and fast delivery of the job they carried out
Johan and Ollie were very friendly and professional when updating our  broadband They did an excellent job and left the area very tidy
Lovely guys who done the fitting Wasn’t as straight forward as first thought but did not complain and done the work super fast Didn’t leave a mess and were very friendly
Dave and Mike did a very good job Installing our fibre upgrade professional and detailed in explaining everything
So okay Thanks
The workmen did a lovely clean job  Very polite worked well together
The engineers they use are excellent and we’re very respectful I would have been more impressed if they had turned up 5 days earlier on the day they were supposed to
Very polite explained everything couldnt have asked for more Chris and Cameron fantastic job
Dave and Mike did a brilliant job with the installation of the internet at my house Thank you so much
They worked as a team and knew what they were doing
Very good and and tidy also on time brilliant service from the engineers
The Engineer was very kind and friendly he instore everything and explained to me about the system a d how it works It was a great experience and I am so greatful Thank you so much
Overall the experience was great Costumer service was helpful and the people on the ground provided a professional service Your company is taking internet connection to the next lvl and if it is as great as advertised only time will tell I hope you will one day cover the hole globe As a consumer I realise that you not only giving a next generation internet connection but in the same time you have opened the market for competitors so we the consumers ended up with better internet for less money THANK YOU
Installation very quick and straight forward via cable from telephone pole They called around 15mins beforehand to let me know they were on their way which was very helpful  Told them where we wanted the router to be placed and they were happy to do so Cleaned up after themselves Broadband is definitely faster Cant comment on reliability yet as we havent had it long enough
Hamraz Jake and Ryan was fantasticThank you
The experience was great except for smoking at my door which I thought was unacceptable and detrimental to my health
Helpful quick and polite
Spoke to me throughout the visit and explained every step Very friendly staff
Dimitri and Vlad did my upgrade Polite and professional Arrived early and worked quickly
I can’t recommend these guys high enough went well above and beyond in order to get my installation complete and working before they left
Went the extra mile in the dark Helped me setup Were professional and friendly Thanks Brad Chris and Dylan Thanks CityFibre
Cityfibre keep putting letters through my door telling me to switch but they’ve put the connection at the other side of the pavement and so can’t offer the service due to thoughtless instillation of the network on the street They told me that it’s tough luck the council won’t let them dig up the pavement again to fix it Sure they still include our house and our neighbours in their ‘connected’ statistics though
I now have incredibly fast FTTP broadband service through CityFibre network   way faster than what I used to have through FTTC network and at a very competitive monthly price plan too Another fantastic thing about FTTC is that you dont actually pay landline rental You want broadband only service through CityFibre network No problem  you can have it You are not obliged to pay landline phone rental again
The two techs who came Vlad and Dimetri were very polite and got me finally connected in a very professional and fast manner
Was supposed to have an engineer come round tomorrow to hook me up Been waiting 2 weeks for it Got a call today saying it had been cancelled because its not cabled to the building What a waste of time Had an email a month ago saying the network is complete in the area and please take the service etc Why get me to sign up for a contract sort out the direct debit everything just to be told a day before that its not possible I rang Virgin media just now took out a contract and they are sending out the new modem Ill be online within 2 days of ringing them Wish Id just rang Virgin in the first place To be clear City fibre spent weeks digging up the path outside my house and up the road but apparently its not connected even though the work is finished and it still says on the City fibre website thats its all good to go Be warned
Garth and rob were gentlemen had a problem with rueter but they persisted and got it working Excellent service
Ollie and Johan were polite friendly and did a very good jobTidied up after themselves and made sure everything was working before they left
Installation rescheduled three times already They show up on the date walk around for few minutes and leave without providing any feedback or reschedulling I have to phone vodafone and learn that internal activation is missing whatever that is I suspect is a standoff between ladder and hoist crews Update 04012023 they gave up on providing new dates city fibre refuses any responsibility due to agreement with vodafone that only they will contact me Vodafone does not bother to contact me at all Pretty fun experiance glad that I have not canceled my existing provider as would endup without internet since 15122022
The engineers were very personable and friendly as well as being very professional Very quick and clean job Highly recommended
Big thanks to Dimitri and Vlad for the quick and easy installation and process Very polite and efficient
Excellent installers Dimitri and Vlad Really helpful quick and clean install 
Ordered a service through one your providers and an appointment was scheduled for the 19 December between 1300 and 1800  No one turned up for the appointment and when contacting your provider I was advised that the earliest appointment was January Miraculously an appointment was found for today 21 December between 08001300  It is now 1220 and no one again has turned up it will be nothing short of a miracle if they even do bother to turn upEdit They didnt bother to turn up and the provider now states that they shouldnt have put the other through as they are not a provider for City Fibre in our road
Callum and forest arrived this morning Explained to me about the fibre they were fitting and how it works They spoke to me about the best route for me as I have a child in the house and wanted the wires out the way of him They were very happy and efficient Very happy with both of them  would recommend them to do other peoples houses Very exited to have faster internet in my home
Fast installation workmen polite and well informed
Great service all done within the time suggested Very please with how it was installed indoors as I have just had my lounge decorated and they treated it with great care
Correspondence perfect engineers great
Has and Dallas came for broadband installation  and they are greatFriendly and got the job done in no time
Awful didnt turn up no one called emergency reappointment for next day but they didnt clear the job or give the modem model numbers over so I had no Internet for 5 days worse experience ever
Fast tidy nice amazing people
Efficient helpful very well presented
Information provided in advance of visit on time and very good slick service provided  No issues at all with the installation
Excellent quality
Great service quick install would recommend to everyone  Thank you so much 😊
Excellent service on time did good tidy job would highly recommend
Very efficient and clean excellent service
Amazing Internet speed exactly as promised
Excellent service for a free upgrade to City Fibre
No boot covers worn by the engineer on a rainy day Broadband stopped working after 36 hours of running Extremely disappointing experience
Had fibre in stalled well all its done is buffer it dont work good in bed room even though small bungalow  they wouldnt install  in room as apparently  they cable dont bend round corners of house not happy what point in paying  for better broadband  when its crapper than my old standard  one
My experience was great as the survey was straight forward and so easy to do And cityfibre were great
Barry and Mark came out to us really nice great work amazing install Thank you so much guys
Could someone of City Fibre explain to me what is UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCESI had an installation scheduled for yesterday December 19th however the engineers did not show up at my residence The funny thing is that they show up at my neighbor I was working from home and I could follow the installation being done at his house but at mine no one showed up The reason is up there And my installation just rescheduled for January
They provide quality service in completely the installation smoothly and effectively Route was set up and instruction was clear in term of placing the boosters and for any issue relating the connectionJulius and aden was very polite and helpful
Absolutely appalling service Has made me livid and blood boil today Terrible while installation was ok ish they have left me now with zero internet as they did not bring do not stock and do not supply the basic cables And talking to a human is so difficult I wish I would have left my old solid robust and fast copper internet So angry with way I have been treated todayAnd made matters worse I have had to  and just brought my ownCables and it does not work 😢Edit thanks for the reply not Why not just simply ignore my post but you decide to infuriate me more by posting the most useless response ever Your reply is so disrespectful and you should have just said nothing City fibre asked for a responsefeedback and then you comment that seriously…
update 31st January 2023Vodafone managed to talk me into going ahead with an install booked for 1st February tomorrow but guess what happenedYup Cityfibre have once again postponed this time with less than 24 hours noticeAbsolute jokeupdate following replyI am not filling out your general form vodafone contacted city fibre and apparently there is some device required because I live in a flat Cityfibre hope to have the device fitted by 30th January but that still isnt guaranteedWHY ARE YOU TAKING ORDERS YOU CANT FULFILLAnyway Ill be avoiding Cityfibre like the plague so no broadband with Vodafone or TalkTalkCancelled install 47 hours before it was dueMy girlfriend works from home so she had arranged to work elsewhere on install day I have arranged time off work that cant be cancelled and my old service is due to be cancelled in 2 days right before ChristmasNo explanation why just weve cancelled your date heres a new one next year on the 30th January
On day of the installation the engineer polite he even left his phone number in case any problems answered on all of my questions even on these which wasnt in connection of the installation The boys done the job quick and left the house how it was before
Very nice communication Did job really fast Tidy up after Very good service Highly recommend 🙏🏻😇
Prompt turn upphoned before arrivingprofessional install and communication let down by a no light fault which took a while to resolve
The installation process was made fast and easy and the engineers who installed were friendly and nice
Jack and Alex and their colleagues were fantastic Really warm funny nice and super efficient  our new internet was installed really quickly and they took the time to talk it through with me once done Thanks guys  I couldnt recommend them more
The service was excellent and the employees were very helpful They also explained everything to me perfectly and conducted all work professionally
Really happy with the service friendly workers come round and make sure they clean up after them and make sure Internet works before they go
Work done quickly and efficiently with friendly work men
Engineers were professional polite got on with the job explained where they could install the equipment best position out of eye sight Cleaned all the mess Excellent job very pleased
Was called 20 minutes before arrival they where polite and explained what they planed to do asked me where I wanted the hub to go covered there shoes when entering the house cleaned up after and went through how to work hub and how long it would take before it would be fully operational Good job
The two engineers were very informative of the product They were very friendly They explained how the city fibre worked I cant praise them enough A true asset to the company
Really impressed insulation was fast and engineers were helpful when they came in to install the FTTP
Installation was quick efficient and left tidy The engineers were polite explained everything they were doing and why Worked well as a team Network has been running well since
Friendly and fast service Very pleased
Excellent communication prior to the appointment Engineers were quick tidy and friendly
My connection is down and it hasnt came on after being advised from Vodafone that it would be on at midnight
Great communication hardly any wait for an installation date installation team were professional quick and tidy
Very good service but need to clean mess up on new carpet fitted but overall very good
The lads who visited were extremely professional friendly and polite  In and out quickly no fuss any mess was cleaned up and taken away  Can not praise or recommend them enough
McCauley and Paul were great very quick and good communication throughout Wifi was up and running before they left
Neat and drama free installation thanks to Johan and Olly
Update 201222   CityFibre rejected second order Contacted them again today via online form Same customer service rep responded saying the same thing Wont explain why if engineer visit is booked to upgradechange connection when switching ISP I would need to cancel internet service in the first place just for engineer to come out remove connection place order different engineer to come out and fit new connection in a few weeks Customer service rep wont escalate case to manager which is part of CityFibres complaint procedure apparently By CityFibres logic while on their network I will need to cancel my service every time I want to switch ISP in the future But they cant tell me why  Current ISP have never heard of anything like this and havent been much help ISP I want to switch to have told me CityFibre will just keep rejecting the order Supposed to be fancy new network thats going to futureproof broadband and you cant even switch ISP without hassle So I should just never have upgraded in the first place and I would have avoided this problem When querying why nobody called me back was told it can take up to 10 days Its been about two weeks for the first and just over a week for the second CityFibre sent a request for more info through here which Ive provided but doubt I will get any sort of helpful responseFed up of dealing with them put complaint in with ISPA instead Will escalate further if this doesnt go anywhereOriginal review  One of the worst customer service departments Ive ever dealt with if not THE worst CityFibre handled the full fibre upgrade for my previous ISP No problems with this I want to add and after that I thought Id get a better deal by switching to a new provider This ended up being the most complicated ISP switch Ive ever gone through for no reasonCityFibre rejected my first order made almost a month ago because they couldnt connect the area line box to my home They had already connected my home through my previous provider so this didnt make any sense to me Nobody from CityFibre told me the order had been rejected so I waited about until the scheduled engineer visit just to find out nothing was scheduled seems pretty standard based on other reviewsAfter a lot of wasted time back and forth the ISP I wanted to switch to was able to place a new order which seems to have been successful although the switch hasnt actually happened yetIt was explained to me that there needs to be an engineer visit as they replace the line going into the property when you switch ISP for optimised connectivity Im not sure on the specifics or how accurate this is but thats why I apparently couldnt just get a new broadband hub and use the existing connection I contacted CityFibre near the start of this month more to find out what happened rather than make an actual complaint as such Nobody responded to this initial query so I had to raise another one a few days laterThe response I got was just stupid to say the least A customer service rep told me I would need to cancel my internet service with my current provider before I could switch to a new one In what circumstances do you have to cancel your entire internet service before being able to switch ISP You dont You dont have to do that at all I told him Id been able to do another order through my chosen ISP and this seemed to have been successful I also asked him to confirm the new engineer date was going to go aheadThey didnt even bother to respond   Every time I have contacted CityFibres customer service department since they dont respond and all I get is an automatic email saying Following a thorough review you should have now received our response to the complaint you made to us and so we’re marking the case as resolved on our systems Despite telling me I should have received a response I never doI have had three separate complaint reference numbers for the individual times Ive contacted them which are now closed and two open ones still waiting on a response Out of five separate contacts CityFibre have only bothered to respond once and then it was just to say lol soz ull haf to cancle ur intrnt b4 we can cnct u aganCityFibre dont really seem to care if they make a switch needlessly complicated even if you are currently on their network wont offer an explanation or an apology offer questionable advice and for the most part dont really seem to respond410 for customer satisfaction when things go wrongI was also scheduled for a call back twice during this process nobody ever called obviously
All went to plan Installers were polite and left the house clean
Hamzah Ryan and Bill they fitted internet fibre today for me I am so impressed they are very kind and polite They clean after work so my house is without a mess All of this job took around one hour I am very happy with they service
The engineers were great Quick installation and the speed I am getting from the broadband sooo fast
Great work Good customer service
Still waiting for fibre to work even many attempts  from to call  no one able to help and find the problem I have the same bad experience  when I moved to my new house  I amnot happy  at all
Really nice guys got straight onto jobVery polite and made sure all was up and running before they leftThank you
Excellent job carried out by the engineers in sub zero temperature
Installer arrived within agreed times phoned 20minutes prior to arrival at my homeExplained fully what was going to occurr Had issues at end of the processes not City Fibres issue down to my CSP
I wanted to make a complaint about the services you provide I have been deprived of internet access by you for over two weeks and I am going through a stressful situation with your Internet service providers Digital Home ZYBRE Vodafone and of course CityFibre It turned out that my fiber internet service is blocked by the still active ZYBRE service on my address despite my termination of the contractThe whole story began over two months ago In 2022 I learned that a new optical fiber network was being built in the UK and Coventry became part of this network I have been a Virgin Media customer until now and in my opinion the service and quality of Internet services was not satisfactory enough for me That is why in the fall of 2022 I signed a contract for CityFibre fiber optic internet with one of your designated internet providers Digital Home I signed the contract two months before installing the CityFibre fiber at my home because the contract with Virgin Media was ending on December 17 2022 The CityFibre installation team made an appointment with me and connected my house to the fiber network on December 16 2022 and since that day my problems with your service started the router previously provided by Digital Home did not allow access to the Internet The Cityfibre fitters told me that I had to contact Digital Home about this I wanted to do it but it turned out that the company no longer existed and after calling CityFibre I found out that my new supplier was ZYBRE ZYBRE employees were unable to provide me with an Internet service for over a week and the companys service was at a very low level the advisors did not keep a record of the history of my conversations with them and each phone call to them began with me having to explain the whole story from the beginning a veritable Groundhog Day ” which caused me great frustration After a week of these ineffective actions on the part of ZYBRE I was left with the prospect of being left without Internet for Christmas So on December 23 I decided to terminate the contract with ZYBRE due to their failure to fulfill the contract for the provision of Internet services On the same day December 23 I signed a new contract online with your next supplier Vodafone After Christmas without any notification the contract with Vodafone was canceled After a few hours of difficult chat and phone conversation with a Vodafone advisor I managed to explain the situation and Vodafone employees understood that I already had access to optical fiber from CityFibre and not as they had previously informed me that my house had no possibility to connect optical fiber On December 30 I signed another contract with Vodafone which was canceled again without notifying me I found out about this cancellation on January 1 while trying to track the shipment of the router from Vodafone My conversations with Vodafone on January 1 2023 were very difficult and stressful they lasted several hours advisors told me that I did not have a fiber optic cable at home that I could not connect highspeed Internet made up various ridiculous stories for the fact that they are not able to run this service at my house They finally understood what the problem is that my service is blocked by the still active ZYBRE service on my address Despite the fact that I terminated the contract with ZYBRE I have confirmation of this contract cancellation CityFibre employees did not know anything about it and each time they canceled my orders with Vodafone due to the still active service at my addressThis is the situation today I am without Internet from you each cancellation of the Vodafone contract postpones the activation of the service by another two weeks today is January 2nd and Bank Holiday in the UK the earliest prospect of Internet for me is January 17th at the latestI am asking you to treat my case seriously and quickly activate my service with gratification without involving me in your procedures as was the case in talks with Vodafone advisers urged me to deactivate my order with ZYBRE even though I terminated the contract with ZYBRE and I have confirmation of this  and deactivating the service is unlikely to fall under the responsibility of the customer which I amKind regardsSlawomir Furgalski
We had new fibre installed via City Fibre and the two engineers were excellent fast professional and personable They left everywhere nice tidy and were v efficient Cant recommend highly enough My service is fab and super fast
Great team set up efficiently and quickly Cleared any mess up  Nice friendly lads Great service and Im happy 1010
Very happy with our new internet installation in our new home Macaulay and Paul did a great job digging  cleaning and connecting the internet 
The engineer was polite and on time Very friendly and explained everything he was doing well He was clean and tidy and showed me all he had done when completed I am very happy with the work carried out I am yet to try the internet out but so far so good Thank you
Great all round service everything was carried out as per expected
Not a fan of the shoddy work completed Front of house looks ducking horrible with a brown box not where I asked for and an extra unnecessary wire snaked around a new 3000£ front door Not happy at all
Installation was good however my internet still does not function My ISP Reseller is Air Broadband and their new customers recently dont seem to have internet This seems to be an ongoing issue with new CityFibre customers going back years from the many forum posts I have readIn reply to CityFibreTrue you dont provide internet to end users and you dont like to talk to us But I do have my CityFibre reference number and will be contacting you directly You installed my fibre line and all seemed fine I then received my router and no internet my ISP has a few customers all recently connected with the same issue The packets reach your data centre but arent routed to the ISPs colo boxes And your suggestion is to replace the ONT and threaten to charge my ISP if its an issue with the router Youre slow to respond to your ISPs and your support seems terribleUpdateI had to tell my ISP it was a routing issue and insist they looked into it because neither of you could diagnose that yourselves You slow replies and laughable fix suggestions surely didnt help resolve the issueSuggestionDont allow companies like Air Broadband or ZYBER Same people running the company to even sell your product They are a complete shambles and provide no customer support I dare say you get calls all the time due to their failings I will have to gamble and try another one of you resellers Zen
Installation was quick on time and no mess left behind The engineers were extremely friendly courteous and explained everything I needed to know Would recommend city fibre
Great services Internet speed its a masingThanck you 
Just switched from my old provider for a service over 3 times faster and cheaper Installing was excellent
Rubbish Internet has not been working for 3 days No update from City fibre no idea when it will be fixed Tried to call but they wont talk to me as my Internet is through Talktalk Talktalk have no update from them USELESS Now stuck as wanted to order last minute Christmas presents 🤬
Great service from city fibre in Aberdeen working great  Just hope direct debit changes to the agreed lesser amount
did the job well no issues getting the install done or tidying up afterwards
Great the engineers were very friendly and explained everything they were quick with installation and honestly would highly recommend
Really pleased with City Fibre so far We’ve only had it for a few days but the speed of our broadband is excellent and there’s not been any downtimeInstallation was straightforward with the engineers discussing the options beforehand The work was completed within an hour and everything was left neat and tidy
It was interesting to see the installation of an overhead cablegood teamwork
Excellent installation Wayne Luke Lewis and Dan were incredibly friendly and gave clear explanations of everything they were doing in laymans terms The work was completed quickly and with no mess Fantastic thanks
The engineers were very polite helpful and explained everything they were going to do and how it worked and answered any questions I had
Thank you Omaid for installing my city fibre box Also for politely answering all my questions and concerns I was greeted by Nazir who introduced Omaid and came into my home wearing protective footwear which was nice and then quickly installed my box and explained everything to me I am pleased with the experience and recommend Omaid and Nazir to everyone
Excellent experience the guy Micheal was first class highly helpful
Engineer was quick and efficient done a great job
The engineers were on time and very efficientEverything was explained in detail every step of the wayTidy and professional
Despite snowy conditions  frozen ground Dominic together with his team Mark  Matt worked hard to achieve the installation the way we asked for  They were courteous and mindful of not trailing mud through the house  They remained cheerful despite worsening weather conditions They were excellent at explaining the new setup after it was installed and answered any questions we had in a way we could understand    All three guys were excellent ambassadors for their company Dominic in particular was extremely courteous  helpful
Quick and professional install of broadband fibre both guys that turned up were polite and friendly
Irin and martin excellent workers great service quick and easy Well done guys
Installation was superb and quick and professionally doneCityFibre installed the fibre and was efficiently done Octaplus support very quick at getting a few initialisation things done quickly and resolved very quick some strict NAT issues I had Speeds over WiFi are now 500600Mbsec vs my old 28mb35 over copper lineHighly recommend them as well as cost is very good for the speeds you can get
Brilliant service from William and Scott Arrived promptly talked through what would be happening and then worked efficiently even with the snow and frozen ground Very tidy and no mess left Made sure everything was working before they left Would definitely recommend
City Fibre installed full fibre to my house in Glasgow yesterday  They arrived on time and talked me through the process how and what would be done and showed me the speed test recording a whopping 800mbps download speed  They kept the disruption to a minimum and cleaned everything up afterwardsAbsolutely delighted with the work done by Alex and Scott from Kelly Communications
Dont bother trying stick with BT openreachI have been waiting since August to get internet installed with a constant barrage of useless excuses always being told the department doesnt take external calls and they will call me back within a day to never get a call backCancels the order without any notification after making me wait 6 hours on on 6 different occasions where they dont bother looking for my address or calling just mark it as not acheiveable then send me emails saying everythings ready to go just to wait another 14 days for the same thing to happen
Great experience Very professional Explained all items clearly
The connection of the fibre was fine and the workman were very polite and used overshoes so they never soiled the carpetConsidering they are telecommunication engineers I was surprised they disconnected my TV ignorantly Talktalk TV uses 2 plugs 1 connects to the TV box and one connects to the internet router and the lads removed one of the TV dongle plugs that connects to the internet router I fixed it cause I had a spare double sided Ethernet cable which I put into the yellow Ethernet hole labeled 1 on my internet router connected the cable to the TalkTalk dongle plug and then plugged the TalkTalk dongle plug into the electricity socket I hope this helps future installations
Micky  Ibo turned up nice and early within my time slot Micky  Ibo we’re very pleasant polite  friendly got on with the job  explained everything very well Well happy with the service
CITY FIBRE GUY WENT THE EXTRA MILE TO MAKE SURE I RECEIVED MY INTERNET SO I APPRECIATE THOSE TWO LOVELY YOUNG MEN FOR THEIR TIME AND WORK PUT IN  THANK YOU
Jake and Jaden are a credit to their employers They attend to fit full fibre broadband Unfortunately due to a problem with cable routing under the street they couldn’t complete the job This does not detract from their attitude and demeanour which throughout was exemplary They lifted all the grates on the street and spent a good 2 hours trying to resolve the problem Hopefully the follow up team will be as professional as Jake and Jaden and I can get internet installed ASAP Over to you City FibreVodafoneUPDATE 16122022 1640hrsAfter spending over an hour on the phone to the Vodafone They eventually contacted City Fibre who say there is no record of the engineer report and there is no evidence that a visit occurred Just that a visit was scheduled The fitter spoke to his manager to arrange a triage whilst he was in front of me Its seems this request was ignored and no action was taken Leaving me without internet and no idea when it might be installed Reduced to one starUPDATE on 19th of Dec 2022 I received an unannounced but welcome visit from a City Fibre Crew Tom and Christina They were here to rectify the issue and attempt the install On this occasion they were successful There was a problem with the connection near the local box So it was a bit of a bumpy ride but now that the service is connected the speeds are as advertised I don’t want to be too critical because the end product is great I think Vodafone’s Customer service is hit and miss It wasn’t all bad but on a couple of occasions I was asked to hold before being hung up on There are no direct coms allowed with city fibre so you are reliant on the ISP Indian call centre to facilitate comms Frustrating at best Probably 10 calls in total The end product full fibre is fantastic 5 stars Getting there was a 3 star experience All the engineers were great It was just getting them there that was the problem
Arrived on time rapid installation great customer service

The engineers arrived on time were professional and courteous and all work completed in a timely manner
Great installation team who carried out the work in freezing and snowing conditions Looked after my property and explained everything from start to finish
CityFibre contractors drilled into the main electricity cable into my block of flats resulting in no heat or electricity for 5 hours on the coldest night of 2022 so far until a team from Scottish Power had to drive from Glasgow to replace the ruined section of cable The contractors denied any culpability when I arrived home and questioned them Zero interest of ever using this company Email complaint and photographs submitted to Cityfibre today
Fantastic service from Tim Ben and Albie Would highly recommend Extremely helpful and went above and beyond to ensure we were happy Thank you

We had our new full fibre installed today and the workmen who came from CityFibre were exceptional They were very polite and got straight to work after explaining the entire installation process They were tidy whilst working and also tidied up after themselves after the work was complete filled all holes they drilled and tacked all cables neatly both inside and outside the house and put all the decorations in our garden back to where they needed to go as they needed to be moved to complete the job They made sure the connection was up and running before leaving and even also installed our new hub and run it thoroughly before leaving We would definitely recommend CityFibre to our friends and family especially the team of Hass Dallas and Fazza absolute credit to themselves and CityFibre Very happy customers
I’ve just had my City Fibre broadband installed I have a very large driveway which I know was an absolute headache for the engineers that attended and completed the job Albie Ben  Tim were a top bunchThey turned up on the dot this morning exactly as planned Explained through the whole process then got straight to workTo say they worked tirelessly is an understatement Every time I looked out my window all three were heads down hard at it And it was FREEZING cold too bless themOnce finished they checked the line ensured I was up and running line speed check over 900mbs
Great and very professional service Excellent crew they explained everything and discussed where we want to put the box Really friendly clean  and quick  Thank you so much guys😃
Great couple installation engineers efficient polite and knew their stuff and got the job done well Thanks guys
Grant and jacob were very helpful today while installing the fibre broadband they turned up as I was leaving to take the kids to school and came back when I got back home within 15 minutes of calling them They kept me updated of what they were doing at all times and helped me set up my app  Would definitely recommend if given the choice

Did not tell us how to connect the old telephone line left me without telephone
After spending the last six years being a sky broadband customer and putting up with their rubbish download and upload speeds I was very excited to see CityFibre being installed within my area…having to work from home until the new year and working in IT I was quick to order CityFibre Full 500 FTTC through Vodafone Communication was excellent and the installation dates offered were quick Install date soon arrived worried I wouldn’t be able to work whilst the installation was carried out I was reassured they would keep my Sky line active  zero interruption Both lads who attended were polite informative friendly and clean The installation of the new fibre boxes both internal and external is very neat and to top it all off I now have the fastest connection and working over VPN  TS is no longer a pain  If you are contemplating switching to CityFibre but apprehensive please take the plunge  you honestly will not regret it
Very polite and efficient workmen after the work was done property was left as it was before they started
I had little knowledge of what they were doing but they explained everything to me in simple terms set up my device and ensure it was working before they left Infact their customer service skill is Topnotch
Shaun and mo  and their team were great very professional and polite and completed the job quickly  we were very satisfied  with the installation

Engineers were brilliant quick and tidy installInternet is very very fast 0
Upon entry to the property Chris and his team mate were confronted with my nervous barky pup Chris however took plenty of time to try and calm the dog was very gently and relaxed with him Hats off to you and your patience The installation was quick an simple Chris explained everything as he was doing it in a well layed out and polite manner I felt very comfortable having him in my home He is a true credit to your company Thank you Chris 😊
Shocking service with no updates on delays Installation done over a month ago but connection couldnt be made No reason given for the delay Now over a month on and still no attempt made to resolve issue The fibre was suppose to support working from home My business has suffered because of this Totally unacceptable UPDATE FOLLOWING CITYFIBRE REPLYYour Engineers never completed the job They left with no fibre no reason given This is totaly your issue dont try to pass the buck
Had to wait a further month for installation due to a fault on city fibre line Was left with no broadband
Let me start with letting you know I dont ever leave reviews but your engineers are an absolute credit to your company Chris and Ryan arrived before 4pm and it is now 830pm it is 7 outside and they have worked none stop since arriving trying to lift frozen mono block not once did they complain they were helpful polite and incase you havent already guessed they are HARDWORKINGI am grateful that they have persevered in horrible conditions to get my services up and running and can only hope that this review is seen by some sort of management and they receive the recognition deserved
Professionalism and highest standards of engineers Awesome comms from placement of order of service until installation date
Really impressed with the work undertaken and the due diligence carried by the visiting engineers Grant and Chase  These guys were polite professional and kept me informed throughout the installation  Some problems were experienced due to blockages and later connection issues but the engineers persisted and sorted the problems out to my great satisfaction  Would not hesitate to recommend these chaps and City Fibre to others  Thank you
Brill full fibre installed a few hiccups along the way  But Mo and Shane were great these guys are credit to the company  Many thanks again  Andy sharp
Fed up off every other day ur sales men knocking on my door trying sell me this its called cold calling

Just had Zen  Cityfibre installed and so far so goodA step by step summary of what happened during the install for those who are interested  1 Prior to the install date  Received emails explaining what would happen on install date2 Date of install 3 engineers from Cityfibre turned up bang on time with ids proving who they where3 Lead engineer explained what they needed to do to complete the install4 Two of the engineers got to work digging a trench from the network port on the public path outside my house up to the wall of my property5 Third engineer fitted a small brown plastic box on the outside wall of my house Size 8x 6 approx and drilled a very small hole through the wall into my hallway On the inside fixed a little round white junction box About the size of a 50p coin over the hole6 Then he fitted the black ONT box next to a plug socket on the other side of my hallway nearest source of power and run a small cable between the ONT box and inside white junction box7 New Fritzbox router Provided by Zen connected to the ONT box So a total of 2 wall sockets needed or a 4way gang extension lead8 All holes filled with sealant to stops draftsrain etc9 Trench filled back in and my brick driveway returned to how it was before they started Apart from a bit of new mud on the bricks which the rain will soon wash away you cant tell they had done anythingDone 
On time and very friendly install engineers
The two gentlemen were first class from start till finish They were professional mindful of my Son sleeping night shift after the work was finished they hoovered and left my place good as new One of the gentlemen took me through the setup clearly and patiently I gave five stars only because I couldn’t give six👍

They were Brilliant did exactly what i asked them run electrical company so needed things in correct place fantastic job i would employ any of them
Excellent serviceLuke and Wayne installed broadband for my home last Tuesday They were punctual and friendly knowledgeable and professional They left the house and garden tidy after installation Broadband works well
The service provided by the 2 City Fibre engineers when they attended our property was first class from their introduction to the completion of the installation They are are credit to City Fibre
They moved my couch and table But wouldnt move it back Im disabled and my table is very heavy Its took me 30min to move it 2 feet It took them 2sec To move it
Thought they did a good job of installing the fibre exactly where I wanted it in my home even if it was more work for them Unfortunately my ISP hadnt provided a router in time due to Royal Mail problems so I had to set up my own The CityFibre website didnt seem to provide any of the details I would need for this after getting my username and password from Vodafone but after some Google searches I was able to determine the VLAN number to be used for the CityFibre service is 911 Everything else went perfectly though
Respected my property and very competent and thorough and tidy after work completed
Thank you to your helpful and friendly engineers for doing a fantastic job doing my fibre
Quick and straight forward installation pleasant and respectful engineers left no mess
Almost 10 guys came out to help They were all brilliant initial person Haz was amazing and went above and beyond Chase set up the router for me and we couldnt do it without Grant who knew all the problem solving towards the end
Engineers Dave and Mike was super efficient and polite They arrived on time and made a very neat job
Great company went above and beyond to provide me with the speed I needed
Very quick process pre check a week before as a new network and full install on the day as per scheduledGeorge was very helpful  knowledgable and around the install was tidied up when the job was complete
CityFibre service was exceptional The job to connect our house to fullfibre had been made extremely challenging by the civil engineer Clear options were provided to me on how to solve the problem Initial two workmen confirmed work with foreman who I also spoke to personally to provide agreement to proceed Further team of 4 turned up to help complete the job Very impressed with the team effort and solution mindset Completed job reviewed and verified before leaving Cleaned and brushed up any debris Excellent work
John and Daniel have done and amazing job installing internet fiber cable to my house Great job team
Fantastic service Quick efficient and courteous Cannot fault the install and how nice the team were  Dallas Has and Faizan Thank you

Amazing work very happy with the lads they was very professional 👏 Julius and  aidan did amazing job thank you
Has and dales have done a grate highly recommend
After getting about 10 threatening emails that they will charge be a fee if I was not in if there was nobody above 18 in the house if if nobody showed up There is a reason why people stick with their current provider because changing one is so much hassle Sort out your house CityFibre and VodaFone
Shane Mo and their colleagues were very polite efficient and tidy Great job done
Great service Great people No messFaizan HasDallas They was professional did a great job all of them Thankyou
Very impressive went for Vodafone 910mbs with Pro 2 router using laptop over WiFi getting 934mbs both ways Works fine with cat 5e network again full speed Installation was quick and left clean and tidy Took till 11pm for connection to work but that was expected
Updated review City Fibre got back to me to say though they gave me the email address I was using the wrong clearly my fault one so please use this new one which I have done 4 TIMES now and its same old same old  no response AT ALL Unbelievably patheticWould be zero if i could put that I have emailed their complaints department on at least 6 occasions now Each time I get an auto reply with a case number I NEVER even get a response despite being promised one within 24 hours What a joke this company is They have no customer service at all and just IGNORE youDO NOT USE YOU WILL REGRET IT
Service its clean and fast instalation make for me great job guys
The guys who did the installation were friendly and explained my options very clearly The work was carried out quickly and no mess Would 1010 recommend
After installer left the system went down completely An emergency engineer came discovered the fault and sorted it The ONT box had failed It was replaced on same day Excellent service
Installation was good in spite of challenging icy weather Worked around block paving Julius and Aidan were neat and efficient Great work
Engineers worked well together extremely polite and professionalVery accommodating and pleasant ensuring the work was done right 1010
Brilliantly done
They worked as a team very efficient left place clean and tidy
Excellent team who installed the connection but 3 days later still not internet unsure if it’s city fibre or Vodaphones fault someone just needs to take ownership
Learn how to clean up after the work is complete
The team that called were faultless tidy in their work and cleaned up too Service was up and running after updating without any hitches 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
What a change to have engineers that listen to what you wanted Nothing was too much trouble for them  Brilliant service
I see a lot of negative feedback for city fibre and some of the service providers but as business owner myself I find that when people get what they expect they don’t leave feedback Which is fine but the ones who have a bad experience always leave negative reviews so it makes it look like the company isn’t any good I would highly recommend city fibre to anyone who is looking to change provider or any new install I’m not getting the stated speeds but it is well above what I had before for half the price Installation team was polite clean and did there work well
Clean installation was provided on time and everything was clearly explained
Quick clean efficient and professional and very nice guys All round great experience
Excellent service from point of order and delivery
Great service superfast Full fibre broadband what more can be said
Very professional engineers Polite and respective
They can improve via real human communication I was never told when theyd be here I was never told the specifics of what they were doing eg I didnt know theyd have to drill a hole in the wall Now the internet doesnt work at all and I keep getting told theyll contact me but its been weeks with only mobile data
Id like to thank City Fibre for monitoring the trust pilot comments Although I am not directly your customer I appreciate  the support you gave me
On the first day of install an engineer was booked but he didn’t show…On the second day I complained but no one seemed to care and on day one a no show installOn the third day I was told not to bother them again no one cared and a day one no show installI could go on but I can’t make it scan properlyAnyway engineer no show no communication problem with the line blamed on service provider not sure how complaint ignored told to wait have descended into seventh circle of hell waiting for resolution meanwhile uncancelled my copper line broadband with BT who have been great  Just a shame no other fibre alternative because this really sucksUpdate City Fibre claim below to have tried to contact me about this  This is not true  They have simply replied to this post  I have sent in contact details via different media but no contact has been forthcoming  I would love to engage with them and understand their challenges better but they clearly do not feel the same
Very pleased customer Exceptional  service As an Emergency call handler that works from home I completely rely on a good internet providerconnection … buffering…what’s that
Scott and Alex from Cityfibre did my install today they had the fibre cable installed within an hour  They were a brilliant bunch of lads and their work rate was excellent   They tidied up once they were finished  I’ve been waiting ages to get FTTP and I’m over the moon with the speeds  Rating 55
George and Andy were very good and professional
Super service The guys were polite and happy Talked me through the process did a great job and left no mess Thank you
Quick and smooth process Great internet service so far
The two guys that came to install my new broadband was really good and efficient and knew exactly what to do with the installation Really impressed with the service thank you
Julian and aiden fitted our city fibre nice easy installation and left my property clean and tidy
I was happy with the the engineers as they was every helpful as I don’t normally feel safe with around male employees but they made me feel so comfortable and they ensured me that I was ok and they was happy chatting to me so I am supper happy to send a review and they also show me the job they done and also happy with it aswell
The engineers were very helpful nice and patient with the process I had forgotten to view the info sent beforehand but they explained everything that I needed to know and waited for me to quickly get permission from my landlord considering there was snow on the ground and it was freezing outside Very easy to get along with Thank you so much for installing fibre to my flat
The two engineers were friendly and pleasant and very sensitive to my sons disabilities Thank you for your understanding
Tony  Connor have just left after installing my new broadband phone service Apart from the new hardware you wouldnt know theyd beenTidy job polite friendly blokes 5 stars from me
I would just like a good service good installation and a reliable fibre connection to my home where I need it that provides me with internet like I had from 2008  2020 provided by FibreCity Wessex Ltd then later Gigler Ltd Yes Im a legacy customer And was a happy one Fortunately one of the first few hundred in EnglandUnfortunately Vodafone bought me from Gigler when they sold their customers in 2020 For 2 years with Vodafone Ive been without Fibre to my home stating that they needed to upgrade the network while mine was working fine before the takeover 860mps download wasnt too shabby And great customer response and communicationSo whos in charge of this network upgrade stated by Vodafones gigafast team back in 2020 YesCityFibre So what am I aware of that has been carried out in the last 2 years by CityFibre Well I know you have replaced the plastic cover on the pavement for my internet terminal I believe its called a Toby and youve filled the internal box with material possibly concrete Why2 months ago I was informed by Vodafone  that I now have access to fibre if I want itI agree and placed the order6 weeks ago 2 representatives from Kelly Communications arrive on horseback shouting Yeehah Seriously they might as well have been One removed my existing underground fibre cable housed within protective conduit from the front garden Then drilled a hole in the top cover Toby to install a new fibre through the top of the pavement box thread it through my neighbours privit hedge lay on lawn put a polythene sleeve  over it then partially bury it one inch deep across my neighbours lawn to the property Then connect to my existing terminal box by my front door What a jokeThe other rep internally replaced my existing ONT for a cheap low grade version redrilled the wall inserted cable through wall to the outside and back in through open window By the way my window has been open for 4 weeks now in cold weather With brick dust and cabling equipment scattered over the floor Other issues here is he stated he could not fit the cable externally on 2 faces of building to connect with box by front door without drilling paires of holes every 23feet around the building which is not acceptable by me The cable would be in the same position as the existing below the eves which I never needed my property destroyed when that was installed in 2008 I live in a first floor flat And the existing cabling position is unobtrusive and well installed avoiding all external fittingsI suggest if health and safety is an issue for these self employed reps of Kelly Communications then why do they not carry the correct equipment to do the job properly without the need to drill unacceptable holes in wallsJob was left Vodafone called to say CityFibre had cancelled the job I told Vodafone the job was incomplete and to an unacceptable standard Vodafone asked me to complete a new order which turns out to be at a higher price than my existing order which I have since questioned I plan to cancel my order with Vodafone if within 14 days of going live in future my bills are higher than my existing order But first I need an internet connection Vodafone and Kelly Communications has not communicated well with CityFibre because today when Kelly Communications arrived for the second time on behalf of CityFibre it was another wasted visit Because they knew nothing about the job And could not proceed as unpreparedI need DIRECT communication with CityFibres managerdirector of operations To discuss plan of works to move forward with my installation Yes a direct line phone number would be required at this stage My patience has run out
Tommy Shaun and Abs did a fantastic job today installing my broadband Very helpful and polite
The city fibre engineer did a great job Im very pleased with the installation He went through all the details and explained everything
Quick setting up the fibre broadband  all working fine and friendly engineers shame I don’t remember there names though

Came to install fibre within our home Friendly guys Automatically put shoe covers on to come in the house very impressed Job took a bit longer due to some issues with the router but all resolved with good communication throughout Discussed what they were going to do prior to starting and showed us how everything worked after One of them was learning so they were making sure to explain everything and ensure it was completed Thanks to Ashley Wayling and Omar

Fantastic service Barry came to the door explained everything and him Mark and Mick got to work immediately I had to leave them to collect my Pup  Felt confident trusting them to do as required Came back to tidy house and garden Again everything was explained by Barry regarding inside and outsideFirst Ckass Team and Service
Very impressed with the work done by CityFibre to install my Broadband services from Vodafone Engineers visited for an initial inspection which they found a completely blocked duct and pipe work They had another team booked into fix the blockage They arrived 2 days later and spent almost all day identifying and fixing which they had to dig the pavement for good 20 feet to finally lay the new fibre cables As soon as they are done the 2nd team came to secure the unfinished work so no one will injure The very next morning the 3rd team came and repaired the entire area to perfection Soon after them a loader came and took all the tarmac removed and cleaned After them another van came and took all signage and barriers left the site as it was before A few days later 2 engineers came and installed the final service and connected to the internet A job well done and Im impressed Thank you for a well organised job and service
Julius and Aidan were very helpful and gave correct advice
Brilliant The two engineers that attended were friendly and professional and patient with me having a dog and a toddler They did a great clean job Couldn’t recommend more
Just job well done Fast proper and high quality
Engineer was on time and called text to let me know he was on his way Installation was simple Engineer explained what I need to do next and left me his number to contact him if I had any problems
Generally good communication  it would have been even better to get a more specific visit time at least the day before Engineers were polite and respectful Happy with installation
Very good lads who took me though the full install and Whot was happing all way though from start to finsh
Very Professional and friendly and put the router where i needed it
Easy installation Stefan  Martin were efficient friendly  helpful Minimal disruption  mess Thank you
Very friendly and knowledgable installation technicians who provided us with our new full fibre installation The whole process was fantastic A
Great install from Brandon and Daniel Goodclear communication from the start They were fast and very neat throughout the whole process Left house cleaner than when they started Thoroughly recommendEastbourne East Sussex
I reviewed CityFibre earlier in the year A few months later they had actually got their act together and started to offer a service in the area Service has gone off twice in 5 months one outage for I thought 3 days but with no compensation for loss of service another for 24 hoursOverall the service hasn’t been too bad and speeds whilst in some cases are lower than what are supposed to be guaranteed at different times of the day it is still okBiggest positive is the upload speeds
Bill  Billy brilliant install provided the connection point where I wanted it very quick and did not leave until I was up and running  excellent service from two well focused young guys Citi fibre look after them in Eastbourne East Sussex
Lads were friendly and did a good job nice neat install Talked us through everything we needed to know
Very efficient workmanship Friendly engineers who explained everything in detail Thanks guys
The people from city fibre have been quick in working and explained us everything They were polite and friendly
Jake and Jaden came to install CityFibre into my new home The house is over 100 years old and made of stone with a stone garden wall  they did a great job of installing everything so it is virtually invisible and I would recommend their installation to anyone
Julius and Aidan did a thorough job polite n courteous Job Well Done Lads 
Do what they say they are going to do no taking days off work just to be left sitting about only for them not to show up everything is planned in advance fitted really quickly within an hour no mess
Ive been with City fibre via Zen Internet for approximately 3 months Installation was fine Speed very good But reliabilty has been woeful Odd drops out for 5 mins here and there Then 4 DAYS down last month This month Im currently experiencing an 8 DAY downtime Zen have been helpful but City Fibre wont even give an estimate of when it will be fixed DREADFUL SERVCEAVOID IF YOU VALUE RELIABILITY
The signing up process was easy the price was reasonable and the installers did a good job They cleaned up after themselves and were friendly and fast They installed it exactly as I requested and I am happy with the install and speeds I have so far
Dominic and Sean who installed my wifi arrived on time explained what was going to happen and got to work immediately with no mess and completed works fairly quickly and I am now using my super fast broadband to type this review Not even 30 mins after completion Excellent job they are a credit to the company
Everything as promised
Dallas and hasral done good job nice and clean everything
Harrison and Will came to install my Vodafone fibre cables and did an amazing job the cables were laid exactly as I’d asked  I have no complaintsThey were both really helpful polite and tidied up after themselves I would highly recommend
Had City Fibre upgrading my internet today in Aberdeen Both John and Daniel were top blokes explaining how the installation would work and made sure that everything went to plan Would highly recommend
Polite clean workers Everything explained and very considerate and helpful
George and Andy theyre great and professional
Quick and polite All well done
Engineers were great installation was done in no time Speeds are great and no issues so far
Came on time did the work and explain everything what they was doing and tidying up after themselves
Alan and Colin were on time informative helpful personable and efficient Couldnt ask for more Internet was working almost instantly
The whole experience of getting Vodafone  CityFibre installed has been terrible  truly awful customer service  The first time Vodafone said they were putting us on one contract but in fact put me on a worse contract  which I then had to cancel  The second time Vodafone and CityFibre cancelled the contract in error but didnt tell me so I waited in for a morning for an installation that never happened  The third time they turned up late after 2pm for an 8am1pm installation and then left without properly connecting up the wiring outside leading to yet more wasted time on phone calls and online chat to Vodafone  I have wasted annual leave days on these jokers and countless hours on phone calls and online chats to try to sort out their errors  Without question my experience of Vodafone and CityFibre has been some of the worst customer service Ive encountered in years  Really just hoping the broadband works now  wishful thinkingUpdate 9 Dec thanks for the reply to my feedback but I haven’t received any follow up email from you
Very professionally Greate service
Quick no stress installation Great support from CF specialist Loving my new broadband
Very professional and on time Very quick and clean
Engineers were friendly and left my home tidy after they’d completed the work Also left the garden as it was before despite having to dig it up You could not tell they’d even done any work
Great operative’s efficient tidy and explained everything to my satisfaction
City fibre did a excellent job and left everwhere clean and tidy showed us how too use the internet and explained everything clear overall a very good and I would recommend this broadband provider too anyone that is reading this
Arrived as stated clean and tidy kept me informed of everything that they where doing and explained everything to me
Great guys quick and tidy
Ive already explained the unsatisfactory installation You could not complete the installation because of the weather conditions but to promise a solution the following day and have to follow up so many times is problematical I am too patient  according to my  wife but I was angry on this occasion
Positives Communication regarding the installation schedule datetime was good the installation engineers arrived on time and were very polite Glad to have fibre installed to my premises Negatives I pay vodapone for a 900Mbps service but can only achieve 200Mbps Im following up this issue with Vodaponecable run made a mess of my lawn  the installation engineers got my new fibre cable tangled up and they were stepping all over it Im not convinced this best practice for installing a fragile fibre cable
Great service from City Fibre Team I would highly recommend however that you do not chose Air Broadband A router was supposed to be provided by them but 7 days later I still have no router and you cannot get through to their customer service number just a voicemail 🤯
Generally a good experience but the engineer who fitted the the fibre connection did not explain that I would not have a faster speeds until I get a new router from TalkTalk
Excellent service Friendly staff
Craig and Jamie top lads fast and efficient friendly and very knowledgeable cheers ladsLee Manning
Mark and James were extremely helpful throughout Quick easy process and communicated very effectively

Ali and AbzVery politequick and efficient and professional
They guys who turned up where amazing Done a really good job  Never have seen speeds like this before Amazing
George and Andy were made responsible for bring fibre to my property and then to install Vodafone router exactly where I wanted The job was professionally handled despite few hiccups in blowing fibre back to the cabinet The hurdles were overcome by the efforts put by these engineers and my router was installed I was advised to give the system an hour to download updates and then connect to the network I am keeping my fingers crossed that after an hours wait I will be connected and start using Vodafone services after an unusually long delay in the activation process Highly recommend and appreciate George and Andys commitment to provide excellent service Steve Choudrie
Gary and Thomas arrived on time explained what was going to happen discussed what I wanted to best suit my property and got to work very quicklyThere was minimal mess and everything was done and I am now using my super fast broadband right now Not even 30 mins after completionTha ks for a great experience and super job
Stefan and David were really great very quick to get the installation done and super friendly
Happy with CityFiber they was quick and on time Thank you
The crew were exceptional  politeendearing tidy efficient and very helpful in getting things up and running and explaining things to me in nontech speak
Very good in letting you know time and day and gives enough time to reschedule  Wore shoe covers all the time when in the house  Left very little mess outside really  All in all a good experience
The fibre broadband works perfectly the only thing is my package is to provide 950M bandwidth but there is around 400M at most as far as I have tested
I had hamza Ryan  Ryan come today to install my broadband and I couldnt have been happier their service was immaculate
The engineers were professional and they were very polite  they did the job perfectly
Mo and AD did a great job sorting out our fibre connection The fixing of the cable on the outside of the house looks good and secure Mo knew what he was doing installing the new router and troubleshooting issues
We had CityFibre put in our street We then had weekly letters to tell us how great it would be and to switch We were the first to switch in our street Giganet their partner came out to install it but a week later and after drilling through our walls and attaching wires to our house it turns out CityFibres subcontractors hadnt installed it properly on our road and 3 of the 4 poles arent connected So the engineers who came out today for the second time have said that the whole thing shouldnt have been signed off as it wasnt properly done in our road Giganet are waiting for City Fibre to update them by email by the 8th and the installers said well be lucky to have an update by Christmas A total mess stressful and I wish wed gone with someone else Ive tried calling CityFibre but am on hold for ages and they havent replied to my email from last weekI WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THEM AT ALL
Luke and Wayne came to install a full fibre line and I couldnt fault it Informed me it was a drive dig and returned the drive to its precious state once they had finished
Just had City fibre come in and install my WiFi great service you can’t see where they have been outside tidy working and very helpful Thanks to Grant and Jacob
Amazing job Everything from start to the end Ali abd Abz is a great professional team who knows what they are doing 10 stars if it would be possible
Great  arrived in the time frame given super quick cleaned up after themselves and helped set up after
Grant was so polite and very informative jacob was superb and very quick They completed job in around 30mins and all my services were live Super happy customer
The lads turned up on time with good communication The install was clean tidy stress free 2 nice guys Just waiting for the router now and should all be happy
Lost broadband a week ago Been in constant touch with Vodafone but City Fibre customer service not helpful at all Just tell you to call your provider Moving forward not great expectations if anything goes wrong again Wishing I had stayed with Sky No problems and it does not bode well for the future if the line goes dead after 3 weeksPlus continual dropouts Seriously unhappy customer Be very careful before you sign up
Great customer service from Omer and wayron Couldnt do enough to make sure the fibre was working properly
Fastclean and professional
Quickly installed everything chatty helpful tidy and apologised for coming just after 8 even though thats when it was booked
Had long term issues with Sky not being able to sort out a fault on Opeanresch copper cable had to use an alternative and CityFibre with new network  was a great option Full fibre to house stable connection with amazing speeds and same price as sky Booked appointment and all connected within a week by very professional friendly engineers installed as per my instruction Very happy gamer would recommend
Brilliant Service from start to finish Couldnt give better praises to the 2 engineers who came Gareth and Matthew They were so nice and polite they set expectations and did everything cleanly Really happy how efficient they were It was a 105 experience for us
The engineer called beforehand was punctual and courteous and the whole process didnt take much time
Very quick installation and given lots of information and consultation Very happy with work done Keep it up 😊
Marc and James were fantasticvery neat and tidy job done with the minimum of fuss 
Be aware of issues with this groupofcompaniesFor a start I wasnt provided with an InternetBox before the installation engineers calledWith me then spending the better part of a day trying to work out the weird boxes that I received through the post were a day later after the install I might addNow Im OK going online and researching what does which and wot  But even I found it hardEven though its not too difficult in the end to set it all up but initially I did find myself staring blindly at two white eero boxes whilst idly wondering what they actually didAlso a text the day before the actual installday itself was a bit abrupt to say the leastNow Id signed up with TalkTalk over 7 days prior to that and then with no communications from them at all over that periodNone whatsoeverBeginning to wonder what sort of contract Ive signed hereOBSERVATIONI realise that CityFibre and their ServicePartners are separate entities  but they should both be singing from the same procedural hymnsheet so to speakBACKGROUNDIm leaving Virgin because of their appalling customer services but since dealing with CityFibreTalkTalk Im now beginning to wonder if this groupofcompanies is any betterOnly time will tell As of the second day of the actual FibreInternet install being completed TalkTalk still havent sent me any communications on the install date hoho nor any information on my account with themInformation from them isnt just sketchy its non existentCaution use the CityFibre  TalkTalk combo only if you know your way around electronic TV boxesEPILOGUEIve now got super fast Broadband but I already had that with Virgin whom Im leaving because of their appalling customer service and even though what Ive gone through with them is grim its still better than dealing with Virgin because CityFibre have actually delivered what they promised to doTalkTalk  not so much
Very fast and efficient serviceshighly recommended
Really friendly installation team the cabling needed to go through lots of trees but the guys did a great job and now getting cracking speeds
Ismail Carl Euan and Saleem all did an AMAZING job today installing the new router from the front of the house to the back They were well prepared and very efficient in getting the job done quickly while cleaning up as they went along They communicated their intentions well and were very polite lovely people Overall brilliant easy experience happy with the service and the internet is super fast Recommend these four engineers to anyone 1010

Great service today from Ross and Natalie good communications and a very neat job Many thanks

City fibre installed full fibre in a clean and tidy manner great service
The perfect installPaul and Joel Eastbourne were very professional engineers Explaining everything and making sure we understood what they were going to doEverything went as Id hoped after being told originally that it could not be installed  Big thank you Paul and Joel
Ismail Carl Euan and Saleem installed my broadband this morning and were nothing but professional quick and efficient I am very happy with their work today
They have no respect for your property their partners GCU parked on double yellow lines making my exit impossible My car was damaged and they would not compensate me for it I do not consider that they are responsible companies and should not have been given the opportunity to do the work and deny liability for their actions I have given your company and GCU ample opportunity to take ownership but you have consistently refused to therefore I have no faith that you will but it was in the westend of Dundee
Chris and Andy turned up on time and explained the whole installation process and left a clean and tidy fibre installation No hassle and worked quickly Great job done
New fibre installation on our street no notice given contractors turned up one day blocked off driveways and started diggingsent cityfibre an email and as was kindly asked to wait 510 days for a reply no issue in companies doing work but jesus let people who live there know your going to do it
Great install from Barry Mark and Michael Nice guys who did a clean install Everything that got taken up for the install was replaced well Happy with job
Quick and tidy installation of the fibre service
Ross and Natalie have just left and they were amazing friendly and just got on with their job Phoned up to give us heads up that they were arriving wore foot covers and was so professional I can’t fault them in any way Thank you
I too am not happy with where the router is next to the front door  The installers should have asked what I use WiFi for and where so it could have been better placed Im a woman with no in depth It knowledge so didn’t realise what problems this could cause I work from home upstairs and my connection is constantly lost and tv upstairs constantly stopping or buffering No happy and can’t recommend My so called slower cheaper basic Shell broadband was a lot better
Martin and Stefan Brilliant efficient service No mess Very quick too  Guys were very polite and friendly
My installation went smooth easy everything was well explained and working brilliant now
Engineers were excellent but the broadband stopped working after 15mins Still waiting
Professional prompt  friendly Great service
Installation and information from city fibre was fine Performance of Internet provider Talk Talk has been exceptionally poor
The two engineers that attended were very professional and friendly they explained everything without us having to ask any questions they done a perfect job even in the pouring rain and tidied up afterwards They made sure we were up and running properly and I’d highly recommend the two engineers that attended my property first class service
The engineers are professional in their approach and work They explained very clearly and left the premises tidy and wearing foot covering to ensure they do not dirty the carpet Overall experience was satisfying
The lads to be honest made me feel at ease
All good Easy to apply for and fitted really quick Cheaper than virgin which is why I switched
Professional friendly engineers who did a tidy job
I’m glad I went with this wifi the connection is really good The app is really helpful and my experience with the instalment was very good I had no problems
Very professional and super fast installation and service
Very fast and efficient Well mannered and considerate engineers
Top marks to CityFibre and their engineers for an absolutely faultless experience Engineers were on time had clear communication and were willing to accommodate my requests for cable routing to hide the cable as much as possible The install was done quickly and efficiently and I think they left the outside of the house cleaner than it was to begin with Great experience and the speeds are consistently hitting the expected throughout
Engineer gave clear instructions during the installation process
Julius and Adrian came to fit my new city fibre network They were both quick and efficient doing the job and I am very pleased with their work Julius was super helpful as it was tricky to install the new router under a built in cupboard but Julius gave some good advice and options on where to place itOverall brilliant service from the both of them
Brilliant job took time to explain every aspect of the installation and did a great job  Well done guys
The internet installation was fast The engineers were early to start work They always explained what they were doing before they did it After the installation they waited to make sure the internet was working and that I was set up properly

Alot of negatively on the reviewNever had a problem great serviceInstalled on time working great
I have never had to clean up after workmen like I had to yesterday mud in my carpet most companies use over boots especially when wet outsideI have 2 door mats they couldn’t be bothered usingDust also where they used the dustpan they brought so well That I could of dealt with happily the mud ground into my carpet not so much also had to provide them with electrical tape to put the wires through the walls as they didn’t have them and the cheek to need to charge drill batteries put chargers in vans for this
The engineers Julius and Aidan were very polite and friendly they worked hard to get the right location for us They’ve not left any mess everything is neat and tidy and the connection and speed is amazing Thanks guys
An excellent service 2 days after i ordered my fibre connection it was installed and up and runningThe install team Ismail Saleem and Euan turned up on time They were polite friendly and clean working They performed the install in a professional manner and left things neat and tidyFrom my experience so far i would highly recommend
Well done to Neil Liam and Conner for a quick well executed installation Broadband working faster than before
Firstly it was a pleasure having 2 women doing the installation traditionally done by men Both Bex and her colleague were polite professional and a credit to CityFibre First class service and installation ps Better the Virgin Media Thankyou
Staff are very helpful
The female engineer was so polite and lovely
In general it was good but I didnt like how the wires were installed outside  They were grossly exposed and without care  Also a brick was chipped in the drilling and it was ugly
City fibre engineers were very professional and carried out an excellent job
Very good service and lovely and polite 2 lads who fit my broadband
My parents have had their phone cut through by the city fibre team installing lines its now been 3 weeks that theyve been cut off due to BT having to reinstall the line again No care or attention by the crews when installing lines
Two young guys called today Dominic and Sean They explained all tasks that needed to be done for installation and how long it would take Very polite and respectful Thanks guys
The engineer was polite and friendly they both explained what the process was going to happen
Put my router at front door naewhere near where I wanted it  Need to skip over a 50m Ethernet cable to get a wired connection Teckle Getting cancelled in the morning  Shambles  Avoid getting City Fibre engineers are obviously lazy b who can’t be arsed putting wiring through the house to get your desired place for router  Need to drag pc or laptops to lobby for a wired connection  Smart laddies
Pauline George and Gary  professional efficient and polite Many thanks
I signed for Full Fibre Broadband 500 Pro via Vodafone on the City Fibre networkCurrently I have 66 of that speedI also asked to retain my landline but now thats not working The City Fibre contractor said he was not trained to do thatThe Pro service offers backup broadband via a dongle plugged into back of router The dongle was in the box but no SIM according to Installer It is now up to me to call Vodafone to attempt to get a SIM Vodafone are calling this a replacement  but of something I did not have in the first place Hardly a seamless serviceMust not forget to mention that the installer smashed through a concrete lintel above a doorway for the fibre cable Then glued the pieces back
City Fibre installation team were quick and made a neat job of the wiring
CityFibre installed FTTP to our house about a week ago and everything has been fine with no problems The workmen did a very good job and when they finished they left the house clean and tidy
Ross and Chris were very pleasant and explained everything they were doing They also were very careful about leaving a mess Ross made sure before he left that the Internet was operational which I very much appreciated
2 lads came to install my new broadband from City Fibre Both well polite and lovely They were especially sweet to my little dog despite all his barking They were very quick and left my house neat and tidy
Installation guys turned up late services only worked for 1 hour 24 hours later still waiting for a engineer I have no broadband
Chris Watts and Andy Walker came out to explain everything even having to alter plans to make it easier and more visually appealing The install was really smooth highly professional and friendly guys Could not be happier with the install the level of attention to detail was superb even the colour schemes of the external box and cable cap to match the house was just impeccable Would highly recommend to all great service all round  absolute superstars ⭐️
Abs  Ali were really friendly and helpful Made a very good job and very clean install
Engener did wonderful job No rubbish Everything was nice and tidy
Had William and Scott out today and were really helpfulSpoke through what was happening and explained everything really  well and kept place tidy also really nice and polite guysset up was great where it was placed wasnt as bad as I thought it would be so thanks again
Ive had city fibre installing fibre broadband today Waylon and Omar were so polite and helpful cannot fault their customer service and knowledge They treated myself and my home with respect A credit to the company A job well done Highly recommended Many thanks
Installed on time internet speed very good
The installation team turned up on time they were very helpful and friendly Did the work to a high standard and we are very pleased with it A1 experience We cant say the same for Talk Talk 😬
There was a minor disagreement about how the fibre cable should be laid but eventually they agreed with my wife and did it how we wanted
Very helpful and friendly  And their work was cleanly and professionally done
Micky and ibo arrived promptly first thing in the morning and explained very well what they had to do Polite clean and efficient engineers big thumbs up 👍
Great and friendly service fast and efficient
Very courteous engineers supported the way I wanted the fibre installed into my property and worked well with the constraints of as 1970s build
The engineer was very friendly polite and they tidy up after themselves
The whole experience was simple and straightforward fast broadband  for lot cheaper than sky
Installation was done completed well and looked great Ali and Abs did an amazing job
The engineers arrived within the time slot They were polite and very informative about what they needed to do and how they were going to do this The engineers dug the garden up to place their cable and put everything back to the way it was garden on a hill so was a bit difficult wouldn’t even know they had touched it In the house they placed the router where I asked and were more than happy to tack new cable in place for me The engineers were very tidy cleaned up after themselves and wore foot coverings when in the house 110 to these guys a far more professional job than the experience I had with Virgin Media installation garden was a mess exposed cable left at kerbside and front house was left exposed into the house Highly recommended City Fibre
Left with no internet told to contact provider who then sent me back to citifibre terrible workmanship left with wires hanging loose outside my window unsightly box put outside upstairs bay window which was not agreed
Being able to get better speeds at better prices
Fast install  service performance better than stated
Stefan and Martin were excellent throughout the install Very pleasant to talk to and considerate of our home They certainly went the extra mile to accommodate our requests and make the install as clean and professional as possible Would highly recommend
Looked into internet with various providers including virgin and EE but customer service was shocking at Virgin and EE couldn’t install for 7 weeks  Cityfibre via Octaplus gave a date of 7 days   Installation was done exactly on the date and time given and despite being a problem to get cable to the property it was done very well and sorted within 3 hours  Speed is exceeding the 150mbs that I signed up for and everything was checked to be working perfectly before they left   Couldn’t be happier with everything so far from this company
The engineers arrived within the time specified very polite and professional and explained the process fully with us before and after completion one happy customer we now have full fibre connected straight to the property fully recommend this service
Both Billy’s were very helpful and professional with instal very pleased with outcome and service very tidy
Engineers attended and where so good at answering any questions I put to them  will definitely recommend
The engineers were super friendly and extremely knowledgeable they explained everything and was very respectful I made them a coffee as it was very cold Thanks guys
Great service and a super product Great value for money and I would happily recommend to all my friends and family
The engineer ls Micky and Carl Had great banter and showed us everything the did every step of the way
Arrived prompt and engineer was courteous and efficient Great service
Great communication fast and efficient installers and excellent high speed fibre broadband at the end of it
Really happy with the guys that came and installed my box today they came early and called me before hand they completed their work really quickly and it doesn’t look like they were even here Really polite guys too
Super nice and patient gentleman He waited 20 minutes outside for me as I was running late in traffic Installation was quick and easy Would definitely recommend
Daniel and Jon were brilliant Very fast
The engineer appointment  was to be between 8 am and 13 pm and they only  arrived 16h30 When they arrived they were really nice and explained everything cant  was for better ones The day they left the internet was working fine but the next day it is not working and for more than 24 hours I didnt  have any Internet and am still waiting  to be resolved
I enjoyed the experience the professionalism and care the engineer took while installing things in my home They asked me where I wanted things to go and explain the whole process including an approximate time of completion The engineer even clean up after himself You deserved 5 star and i would recommend to everyone
Quick installation  friendly engineers Ross was brilliant and explained everything to me as was the team that installed it from the garden  left no mess and was no trace that they were there  very happy customer  Hay Avenue
Great service Very quick and very clean

The engineers were great  They turned up on time and gave me a call before their arrival to let me know they were on the wayWe agreed the entry point for the fibre to my house and they got straight to work which they completed much faster than I expectedThe installation was very neat and tidy and they managed to position the optical termination box unobtrusively in the corner so its out of sightOverall the whole process was seamless and Im delighted I now have gigabit fibre laid all the way into my home
Shane and Mo completed my broadband installation with speed The job was kept very clean and the team were extremely courteous and polite Highly recommend and very happy

Scott and Alex dream team did a brilliant job and installed all the necessary equipment very professionally I am happy 😊
Scott and William just fitted my new broadband very polite and arrived on time and left no mess would definitely recommend
Very polite engineers who informed me what they were doing every step of the way
3 Teams turned up over a period of 4 weeks They either could not do the job or had no tools or simply wanted to waste your time Having taken time off works and 3 wasted appointments I complained to City Fibre and the 4th crew finally got the fibre upgrade completed On each occasion City Fibre appointed Kelly Communications the job Totally useless
Installers were efficient and listened to what I wanted before completing the work to a high standard The broadband worked straight away and I’m completely satisfied with the service
The workmen were fantastic very friendly and explained everything I didn’t understand
Quick and very afficient had me up and running in no time 
Excellent service Knowledgeable and friendly went above and beyond and cleaned up after Brilliant
I was called half an hour before installationInstallation went really wellWorked straight awayOnly give 4 stars due to speeds being almost half of what you pay for
It was fast and the team of engineers were polite and very helpful
We had Micky and Carl out to 17 Rotterdam road they done an excellent job and very helpful on explaining everything about what they were doing through our the job
Hi I am mr modha I will 100 happy to come einginer to fix my service and also all staff is wery good and he give me nice service thank you and thank you again your staff 👍👍👍
Good service great team work and commitment skilled and experienced engineers services with smiles Absolutely great and amazingWell done
Brilliant service The man was polite and kind explain everything very happy
The engineers turned up a little bit early without warning and there were a fair few of them as they had trainees with them but they did a great job overcoming some obstacles in the way large tree Now well connected with superfast broadband using a small independent ISP No One Internet who are by far cheaper than my previous supplierVirgin Media and also have excellent personal customer service
Good to have full fibre to the home which is so much faster speeds than the ADSL we had before in CambridgeStill concerned with speed drops at peak times which are dropping to half the advised speed especially as I could see in road side cabinet that I am the first connection in the fibre box Hopefully this is just a temporary speed issue and this congestion will get sorted on this fibre feed which I understand is split between up to 32 usersYou also need to supply your installers with more and better materials to do fully finished tarmac as not sure how long the pavement will last after the cutting for the fibre tube once winter frozen water gets in to the gap like we see with pot holesDo you have a process for coming back out to top fill the tarmac to make goodOther than that a great job was done
Good service
I do not have a working system because the engineer gave me wrong and bad advice I am very unhappy and disappointed with City Fibre
Great service fast service friendly engineers
Arranged a fitting with a salesman City fibre came in the time given They were friendly polite and worked well with eachother They explained very thing and cleaned up after themselves Connection has been great since having it fitted No issues
The lads were really professional and friendly They cleaned up all there mess too and left it clean and tidy
Only slight snag was trusting that after the installation team had left with the router still not showing a full set of lights it would sort itself out within an hour without needing to do anything The fact I’m writing this means it DID fix itself and has decided it’s now happy Someone in the background around the ordering process probably hadn’t ticked a box or completed a field on their screen So far  that’s it The team have been great neat workers polite real people Happy so far 10 minutes in
Very helpful didnt Leave Job until internet is fully installed answerd any questons and did a neat and tidy wiring job
Brad Jossh and Chris were amazing  Kept me informed throughout the installation  They were all very polite and respected our home  Would definitely recommend as nothing was to much trouble  Thank you 😊
Stefan and Martin excellent quick and tidy job done in less than an hour
George and Andy were proffesional tidy and very nice 1010
My installation was cancelled without notification and no explanation  I was due to have my new full fibre installation today from City fibre and Vodafone Was looking forward to seeing all the hype in action Found out today after I chased Vodafone that it was cancelled After chasing them up I was told by Vodafone that City fibre cancelled it as full fibre not on offer in my location Our neighbour got his last week so that is clearly wrong  Flyers through the door on a daily basis and both websites for city fibre and Vodafone state that full fibre is available at my address If Virgin wasnt so bad at customer service I would give up This is going to be a painful process when it should be a pleasure
City fibre were out today to set up broadband Chris Watters and Andy Walker the people sent to do the job were brilliant They were both polite and professional They set everything up explained how everything worked and took the time to make sure we understood everything We were more than happy with the service
Paul and Zeshan were a delight to have round Extremely professional and great service
Thank you to Micky and Carl that done my install Resolved issue promptly which was due to having low roofs
Alex  Jack were great they are the two Ronnies of city fibre They tick all the boxes Polite very tidy sense of humour explained everything job completed quickly Keep going lads
Cityfibre installed  all very good  Work was done efficiently
Great and friendly experience Timely installation neat and clean Thanks to Abigail  team
George Gary and Pauline were all absolutely lovely They were professional on time polite and super friendly I would highly recommend and an asset to the company  thank you
Professional helpful  respectful of property
Very friendly and work was very tidy and Informative about the set up 
Had Aden and Jake installing today Both were very friendly and professional Made sure everything was up and working and speed was there before leaving Thankyou for your service
Micky and Carl came round to install city fiber for me and did a great job Speed is 900mbs as ordered
Very friendly and helpful guys good work Stefan  Martin
Julius and Eden recently connected me to full fibre They completed the job quickly and with minimal fuss They laid the cable and installed the junction box in a professional manner and left everything neat and tidy
We had Alex and Scott over to fit our new Vodafone fibre internet I could not be happier with the installation The team were friendly and helpful and had the internet up and running super quick The work in the garden for installing the cable was neat with minimal disruption to our garden Everything was left as they found it if not better Inside the wires were run neatly around the room and everything cleaned up and tidied before departure Thank you very much
Brilliant experience with Kelly communications done jobin no time
Quick to install kept me informed on what he was doing lovely bloke very friendly Really happy with the work they did It’s out the way and tidy
Nick and Hamzah did a great job Very quick and neat installation
Brilliant work from micky and carl excellent service
Will and the team of apprentices did an amazing job with our installation super quick tidy efficient and polite Explained everything really well great advert for City Fibre Even made our aloof cat feel comfortable 🤣
The the appointment was great and the internet is working perfect
Amazing service from Mcauly and Paul They both have been great and provided a professional and easy set up service Great meeting the guys and thank you for setting up my CityFibre
The team showed up at 830 for an 811 appointment so that was perfect ABIGAIL was outstanding came in mounted the fibreEthernet box and drilled the hole to connect outside All of it was done in 20 minutes and the internet worked immediately Can’t recommend cityfibre enough If they come out and you’re in a multiple dwelling unit don’t dispair if they can’t get it done first time they will persevere Thanks Abigail and team
I want my old internet box back in my living room as this new one dont work propley none of us can get internet on our tablets and phone
The install was straightforward Although on the day it was very wet The connection speeds seem to be as offered however I have experienced a few signal drop outs which is a bit disappointing Do I contact Vodafone to address this
Punctual courteous and efficient installation though could have been tidier
The two gentlemen were extremely polite and very respectful of my property They never left any mess when drilling even took small bits of rubbish awayThey didn’t invade on my space just got on and did the job wonderful service
this review is aimed at Kelly Communication staff I believe they are installing for City Fibre  TALK TALK in my areaI came home from work to find the van bumped up the footpath even though there was plenty of parking in the road available The main problem was the BIO hazard they left having used a receptacle from the back of the van as a toilet they proceeded to throw it over the road and footpathwhen asked if this was common practice I was met with a volley of expletives and told to get back indoors we are not working for you Surely there is an APP or document to tell them where the local toilets and welfare facilities are there is a pub not 200 yards awayAnother worry was the lack of cones and signs around the van and open box in the footpath so close to a school
First time got vodaphone broadbandGood experience to join vodaphone Good network with fibre  Good service by installation team
So far good speeds 3rd engineer didnt wear dhoe covers and left stains all over the carpet
City fibre came back to fix the installation the day before by a subcontractor when the new fibre optic upgrade didnt work I had previously put in the survey thinking they were City Fibre bit since then discovered it wasnt The boys were very professionalexplained what the problem was and fixed it They also tidied up the job Good job done A credit to the company👏
Grant and Jacob were amazing They let us know everything that they were doing and how everything works They were so polite and friendly Would totally recommend them to anyone
Overall very impressed with the installation and would highly recommend
Trying to get in touch with the relevant people within this company is impossible I have been trying to communicate with the team concerning the installation of a unit in the area and I am being totally ignored This has been going on for over 5 weeks now the customer team on the phone are helpful but the process to move a complaint forward is terrible and incredibly unprofessional No one gets back to you via phone or email Cityfibre clearly ignore customers who have a complaint or are not happy Please don’t bother using their suggested email address they give on these reviews to log feedbackconcerns as you almost certainly won’t get a response
Jordan ross did brilliant job fixing new city fiber broadband in no mess fast friendly guys well satisfied with job no wires or fuss Definitely recommend if you switch over provider up and running fast well happy
Wifi still does not work due to WAN IP address
Lovely guys Kieran and Ben worked fast in appalling weather

Aiden and Jake were very helpful going above and beyond to get my connection set up  Thanks
Nice and tidy installation as opposed to the previous companys attemptPoint to note For anyone with a light coloured exterior although thin the fibre cable is black thats if not having underground installationBroadband working straight after installation was completed
Ross and Carlo were professionals and they offered an amazing service they are very knowledgeable and courteous While I had an issue installing internet fibre due to how the building was built it was almost impossible to do it I suggested a way to install it in the closes room to the street Ross and Carlo were more than happy to do the job and they did an excellent work Can’t ask for more and they made my day Thanks again
Lewis and Dan best service quick and professional
Absolutely brilliant the 2 guys stefan and Martin were great had a laugh with them they explain everything that was going to happen and during the process as well and everything at the end was finished nice clean tidy brilliant job thanks

Brad and jossh very helpful very pleasant too be around thank you
Shane and moe arrived nice and early to get the install done they have done a nice quick and clean installation Cant fault the guys
Very efficient very clean and explained everything well Nicely done
Engineers Stefan and Martin arrived at the time the stated Explained exactly what they would be doing and placed the router exactly where I wished it installed  Quickly installed the full fibre and left the driveway exactly as it was before the installation and standard of work was excellent Cleaned up the area inside the house where the equipment was installed  Finished the work very quickly and apart from the little black box on the wall you would not know they had done any work C with no disruption to the house or garden area  Before leaving they checked everything was working perfectly explained how to go about getting connected and made sure that I was happy with everything and if I had any questions before the left  It was a pleasure to have the work done by two such professional and courteous installersStefan and Martin
We had 5 appointments for the installation before it was completed 2 no shows city fibre cancelled the 3rd without informing us or Vodafone 4th time didn’t bring enough cable 5th time job was completedInstallers Conor Ryan Andrew and Tex were pleasant and efficientA large chunk of brick work broke away where drilling was done and also wood splintered off from drilling too I think making good around damage caused needs to be part of the install works
Very quick and professional engineers they made sure everything is up and running
Friendly quick installationEasy to order online
Excellent service from the team job well done 👍
So professional friendly Explain everything Really really happy
Quick and efficient Very friendly

Kellys installed CityFibre with no hassle no mess and total professionalism Would recommend again

Great team of engineers who worked in awful weather conditions Very helpful and got the job done
Quick and efficient Everything was explained and come out when they said they would Wasnt left waiting around etc
The blokes were lovely that attended the one that came into the house we had a good old chat about more or less everything They had problems getting the Internet to work has they were saying it was blocked But they didnt stop until they had sorted it all out and got it on for me  Good job well done The speed that i paid for wasnt there straight away and was advised to wait 2 hours and if still not at speed tmw to call in He shown me how to do the speed test on my phone as well so i could check later on

The workers were outstanding

Helpful polite hardworkers and informative The installation was quick and straightforward 5 star service
Very fast interaction and very friendly brandon Woodburn and Charlie cowe
The engineers were friendly helpful and were able to answer questions suitably  They were unable to provide specific information about the specific router but that falls outside of their remit  The work was efficient and completed quickly  They were neat and efficient in the carrying out of their work and arrived early
Really willing and helpful workers It was a difficult job because of the layout of the house but they persevered and did a great job
Great fast and efficient install took little time and friendly engineers
Did what they said they would when they would totally happy from start to finish 5 from me
Polite and friendly Very detailed in their approach I am happy with their work
Changed my Talk Talk account to fibre broadband City Fibre turned up with Talk Talk engineers back in March City Fibre dug channel across my lawn and flower beds less than 2” deep No encasement protection on the cable Drilled a hole through the external wall Talk Talk then put a box in the lounge Both parties then declared there was a fault in the line somewhere around the corner Then disappeared A week later they dug the pavement upoutside a neighbours house filled it in and left I made several requests over the following weeks to find out what was happening I made numerous appointments but no one showed up However our security camera showed engineers turned up twice and just pulled the cable to the surface when no one was in I had to try and bury it again myself 8 months on still don’t know if it’s working still relying on phone lineNothing fast about fibre broadband
Great service good advice with regards to the route into my property Martin Cameron and Keiran worked very well to achieve a very difficult installation Thank you
Brandon and Charlie were very efficient and explained everything to me before they started installing fibre and explained afterwards how to connect it Didn’t make a mess and put a sheet down to protect my carpet Thank you 😁
Gareth Scott and Jordan installed my new fibre today and were brilliant They explained everything did exactly what they said they would and worked quickly and efficiently to get us up and running Lovely group of lads and if they are an accurate example of their colleagues I would highly recommend City fibre to anyone
Excellent good guys happy with all work carried out
Tommy Shaun and Hamza were efficient and just cracked on and set up the new WiFi connectionCouldn’t recommend moreMax
Really friendly and helpful guys Rang 30mins before arriving they did an excellent job highly recommended Thank you
Fantastic service chris was helpful
Absolutely brilliant experience with the install  Engineer rang  20 mins later started the job The install took less time than i thought it would thats how good they were I can move my room around now the engineer told me that my TV doesnt need to be hardwired YAAAAYYY  The engineer  his trainee explained everything in detail  made sure I understood every aspect of the install  It was a pleasure to meet  talk with them both I think they are a credit to the company  If I could give 10 stars I would
Fast and easy also very clean after the job donethank you
The boys were very polite and tidy it was a pleasure to have them working at my home
On time friendly polite attention to detail no mess talked threw best options
Engineer phoned to say his team were on the way Arrived as promised and completed the installation efficiently and to my complete satisfaction Engineers were polite informative and helpful
Neil in the bath team did a great install in 90 mins and neat job
Left me with no service or contract number to get help to set up
Micky and Ibrahim were incredibly helpful and professional in their installation today As First time buyer this is our first time having internet installed They made us feel like we were in good hands and carried themselves with the utmost professionalism
Team were polite timely organised and knowledgeable
Despite the internet connection failed and indicated on the router as red the engineer left
Fast friendly and efficient install No more cables through my house
Stefan Natalie  Martin arrived in good time to install router all very polite careful in the house shoe protection worn  thank you Stefan Stefan explained clearly what was involved and our options we had really only one option because of the outside siting Stefans inside work went smoothly ditto Martin  Natalie outdoors Once all wiring was done Stefan set up the computer  laptop Clean job tidied up  made sure all working before leaving Thanks you three
Very good job
Really nice and helpful workers Highly recommended
The Installation Technicians went above and beyond to install to my satisfaction despite having to overcome some difficulties
Guys who installed were great Nice blokes and very efficient Cleared everything after the install and you wouldn’t have known they had been
They left the property without an internet connection and it took four people to determine what was wrong The final person took 20 seconds to tell us the issue Shocking really being as they arena telecommunications company
The installation team are great and did a fantastic job What they dont tell you is that once you have full fibre broadband through City Fibre you are unable to switch providers without cancelling all your services waiting for them to fully disappear from your property records before you can even approach another provider you then have to wait for an appointment to be reconnected This means Im going to be without broadband for a couple of weeks which isnt ideal as I work from homeCustomer Service Staff  Technical Staff seem unaware of this at any of the main suppliers City Fibre know of this issue but arent doing anything to rectify this or to make the issue known to customers before they have fibre installed
I found the guys Stefan Martin Natalie to be very helpful and did all they could to help me with the problem of the blockage in the pipe They were very tidy and left my garden in a very tidy co condition
Great team of lads who installed our Vodafone CityFibre service with no fuss or bother Nothing was too much trouble and everything completed to our satisfaction Top marks
Quick install using the trunk and route I had already dug for the engineers Service was great and was up and running before the end of the appointment No issues at all thank you
So far very disappointed For almost 4 months company cannot find engineers to finish my broadband instalation Some guys shown up twice after initial installation attempt and they made few pictures and phone calls This was abut 3 months After many many calls to provider to ask for help in giving up No chance to contact them as it can be done only by Internet provider call center so if you will encounter any problems dont have hopes for quick fix
Carried out competently and in a timely manner
The engineers were friendly and polite Kept the place tidy and cleared up after themselves
Abigail and her team were brilliant 👏  So quick efficient and helpful Everything was explained and they worked with method and efficiency  No mess discreet installation In sum great job done
Clean tidy professional work well mannered
Polite and professional team Thank you 😊
The team who came to fit our fibre cable were lovely and did the work quickly with no fuss They were super helpful working out where best to site the cable and boxes There were several checks and reminders of the appointment and I can’t think of a single thing they could have improved Thank you
great installation carried out today by Stefan Martin  Natalie very polite cleaned up after themselves wore plastic shoe covers to protect my floors and were fast and efficient at their jobs wouldnt hesitate to recommend them thanks again
Finally had the system installed and I am extremely happy with my speeds now Thank you
Engineers were very professional and explained everythingSo far I recommend Voodaphone broadband
Very professional
Alfie and Andy did a fantastic job Let us know when they were nearly here Polite very clean and did a great job Thanks lads
After installation there is still No internet connection or network
Brad and Connor from Kelly communications did my city fibre installation Good service by the guys and did everything I asked for nice neat and tidy job
Great people to deal with The installation engineers arrived at the arranged time and explained everything They were happy to fit the incoming fibre and wall box exactly where I needed it to go They made no mess and treated the job as though it was on their own property You cant tell where the fibre passes under some of the block paving A painless experience The internet is now really fast too
Liam and his team were very efficient straight forward and very helpful
Nothing wrong with installation process but the Internet is not downloading as advertised Barely 90mbps last night
Horrible experience with CF and their contractors our business has been crippled by plastic barriers for more than 6 weeks workers coming whenever it suits them had to redig the cable at least once and left the pavement unsurfaced with so much dust particles that all the shops resorted to clean it themselves as the contractors were not bothered at all So in the end we were left with puzzle like looking pavement disruption of business and scratched doors and windows as a result of poorly made job Shame on you city council to even pay them for this
Installation engineers were friendly and particularly helpful in ensuring the equipment was installed in the best available location
Great service and people Fast punctual and reliable
Everything about the installation the worker was friendly and talked me through the whole process
Excellent communication throughout entire installation process Gave notice when 30 mins away which was helpful Explained everything really well and were in and out in no time
The guys turned up promptly for the install Polite zero mess and talked me through the whole process before starting
Stefan Martin and Natalie contacted me in the morning to advise when they would arrive They arrived promptly and explained what they would be doing They carried out the work efficiently and were very tidy and polite they explained what would happen with the system before they left
Engineers were very experienced and polite and made sure my Broadband was working before they left
Pleasant and knowledgeable team  listened to fair comments and they took onboard my comments
Very good service Couldn’t fault the two engineers during the installation process 1010
The engineers were very professional and kind They rang me first to see if I was home and they came shortly after Excellent service
Very efficient installation tidy and placed exactly where I wanted it
The person was reslly lovely kind friend and helpful
Very professional and likeable guys They had to do the work in freezing foggy conditions but they did it with good humour Everything was installed quickly with no mess leaving two happy customers Thanks
🎪🎡🎡🎪🤡🤡🤡 3 months after someone from city fibre came to install my internet and left it half finished i still have no internet
Its obvious what the issues are you only have to start putting new install red light and loads of people with the same issues come up For me the install should have been done before the switch over to make sure everything is working before leaving customer without Internet especially if they rely on it to work I have to say that SOME of the people trying to sort it out have been extremely helpful
Engineers were very polite explained what they were going to do and how they were going to do it When finished they tidied up afterwards checked everything was working
Clean workmanship polite and left my property clean and how they found it  a real credit to city fibre  👍 thanks again
Excellent service from all engineers on site Knowledgeable polite and considerate Highly recommended as a service provider
The installation engineers are real nice chaps top pleasant doing a great job good team called me to say they were 1015 minutes from arrival All went well
Friendly quick experienced and professional team
Turned up on time eventually had 3 engineers here Really professional job gave me good advice re where to site the router minimal mess tidy cabling checked everything was working before they left Super job
Engineers were very professional and friendly and promptly done the job
Very clean and neat installationEngineers were were very polite and professional

Chris and Johnny from CityFiber connected me house in less than 30 mins Did an excellent job Very friendly and professional
Brandon Woodburn and Charlie Cowe were fantastic They were quick efficient and professional Couldn’t have asked for more Thank you
Spot on 2 engineers arrived bang on time explained everything did the relatively complex install and tidied everything up after themselves made sure I was happy before leaving great experience
Excellent service Guys arrived on time and were very professionalGreat job
Abigail and the team were very helpful she talked me through the whole process and explained how the box worked clearly
We had the router installed today by a team from CityFibre and everything went smooth The installation was quick and the team were very lovely and professional Also they turned up at the time they said they would which was nice Overall the service was great
Unable to make a connection during installation investigation identified 2 breaks  blockages in the pavement within 200 yds of property  They were unable to provide Vodafone with any indication of when repairs would be madeAfter 3 weeks with no internet and no prospect of repairs within a reasonable timescale Vodafone cancelled the contractNo discernible intent to repair lack of customer support total absence of communication poor quality of original cable installation and no obvious interest in repairingEven with no apparent prospect of the blockage being repaired they came back to pull the cable from the domestic box
Vodafone Kelly Communication and City Fibre nightmare Vodafone booked my installation between 8am and 1pm The Kelly Communications guys turned up at 5pm in the dark to do the install after repeated calls to Vodafone In fairness to the guys they didn’t get told of the job till the afternoon When they tried to put my fibre live City Fibre had gone home As the job had been completed Vodafone terminated my copper connection Daily calls to Vodafone have failed to get the fibre live I have been without Internet for two weeks and counting…nightmare
The cable for the broadband is right in the eye line outside the upper bedroom window  multiple calls to address this has fallen on deaf ears
Had Internet installation on the 15th of November but no router so rang city fibre and asked who is my provider The said due to dater protection the cant tell me  so now have no Internet  not good
I was supposed to have broadband following installation I have no broadband following installation
Excellent service
My appointment has been changed I want to know more about how it works do I need a new router and has my contract with the old internet company been cancelled
Quick  good work
The engineers worked nonstop to complete the installation and made no mess
Luke and Wayne installed the new fibre line with professionalism and quiet efficiency We are very pleased with the results
Work completed quickly and efficientlyCarried out the work in torrential rain dug up garden for cable and returned to as before no mess inside or  out
Freindly and efficient Thank you
Great service received from the guys who were very polite chatty nice and professional Lewis and Louis have explained everything that will be done today and the guys outside have also done a great job They have left the property nice and clean and have helped to move a unit out of the way and returned it to its original place at the end of their job The guys have made sure to wear shoe covers and shut the door behind them even though they were in and out when doing their job Thank you
Unfortunately I normally give negative reviews on companies on trustpilot but this squad from CityFibre was very friendly technical and exceptionally helpful  I wish the service they provided could be adopted by other companies
Stefan Martin and Natalie were very efficient they did a great job in such bad weather They were friendly and approachable and ensured that I was happy with all the fibre upgrade installation process confidently answering questions I asked I am very happy with the work they did
Lewis and Dan just came and fitted my fibre broadband Pleasant and polite customer service was spot on couldnt fault them at all Asked if there was anything else that they could do for me before they left
Chris Connor and Justin were very professional in installing fibre today It wasnt an easy job for them and they did an excellent job of getting things done smoothly Very polite and kept me up to date with what was happening So impressed with their attention to detail and customer service
Arrived on time Explained what they were going to do Worked quickly Were polite and courteous Thanks
Really friendly helpful guys Amazing service No mess no fuss
From start to finish Louis and Dan were amazing Made it look so easy and kept me informed along the way Explained what they were doing at each stage of the job Everything was put back where it was no mess left behind The broadband works perfectly with no issues Thank you guys really appreciate this Fantastic service from City Fibre
We have just had city fibre enabled by Kevin and Paul from City Fibre and are absolutely delighted with their serviceThe whole process took around an hourthe guys were really carefulthe installation is barely noticeable and I am now receiving  circa 100mgs my previous speed being a pitiful 4 mgs with bt copper wireOn top of that the Vodafone contract is 30  cheaper If you get the chancegrab itcant fault either city fibre or Vodafone or the service orientated staff of both operatorsJim and Margaret Emmer Green Reading
They came in the right time slot installed the cable and all made sure all is working and nice and clean Internet is moving fast
Very professional friendly engineers Steph and George replaced my ONT and had me up and running in minutes Excellent service I’m very pleased
Enginer turned up on time explained everything that needed to be done spent time after the installation to make sure everything was working properly great work Gareth Taylor and omid
Friendly and fast Chris and Robbie the visiting engineers done the job without hassle
Have really well done install from esbo and Mickie today was quick and very well mannered talked through the process and explained everything throughly really pleased with what they have done
I decided to change broadband provider to Vodafone which meant an engineer visit from City Fibre Apparently having an appointment means the engineer will turn up if he feels like it and in my case he didnt Two appointments twice I have waited all afternoon and twice there has been no engineer visit and not even the courtesy of a phone call to say its past clocking off time so Im not going to bother This organisation needs a lesson in customer service its a disgrace For the record I am a vulnerable pensioner I dont need this sort of stress and upset
Placed order mid October several cancellations later install date was a pm appointment for 17th November  I returned to my property at 1140 am as they were driving off No calls or text to say they would be early  They never returned  I contacted City fibre who said I needed to contact Vodafone who in turn confirmed they had till 6 pm to return  I got a survey from City fibre asking how well my installation went  WELL IT DIDNT HAPPEN 
Great service from the 2 lads start to finish polite helpful quick and tidy
The guys were in and out quickly with no mess All were very pleasant and helpful
Very diligent and considerate installers accomadated an odd property in Brighton always consulted me about what they recommend we do about getting the cable up to my home neatly and did a thorough job getting new internet running and minimising disruption to the existing brickwork
Lovely guys who came this am to install the full fibre given a 6 hour window  called me and let me know when they were scheduled and arrived promptly     Lewis  Louis  Gav and Alex were lovely and professional and ensured  the installation was stress free Many thanks
Sam and Joe were very friendly and efficient explaining every step as they went System was working correctly when they left and for some hours after but failed overnight  I restart router but to no avail and I now have no broadband
Nice lads Let me know what was what great with my nosy spaniel and very efficient No mess no fuss just cracked on Thank you👍🏻
Polite timely and efficient
To e lads were extremely professional and polite gave full explanation of everything I had asked overall extremely happy
Quick neat and efficient
The internet has packed up Update turns out that they didn’t register the old router and rather than it being an easy fixed I was given the run around for three days only one of those a working one All this for a fix that literally was a flick of a switch at their end
The guys that came to install the City fibre were polite and friendly communication is key and they were fab overall they did a great job and cleaned up after themselves too I was dreading the mess in my newly decorated room but they hid the wiring too so Im very pleased
Really great lads  that installed the service And the speeds are through the roof now
Polite hardworking guys explained everything and then just got on with it Left the work area clean and tidy and services working before leaving
Professional quick polite  what elese could be needed
First class service and top speed internet
The guys were vere helpful Julian and andrew speciallly Julian he was very kind and did the job professionally
Went with Vodafone and City fibre There was a blockage taking fibre to my house Meaning the pavement would need opened to clear the blockage After a month of waiting no updates and chasing gave upcancelled order and Stayed with Talktalk and Open Reach Installation supposed to be 10 Oct 22 cancelled order 17th November 22
THE TEAM DONE A GOOD JOB WELL DONE LADS
Very impressed with the the ease and efficiency in which my new broadband fibre was installed
Poor communication between internet providers and City Fibre No pre planning or awareness of property before installation This could be shared between two companies responsible for change Only after third attempt a lot of time stress and change in work pattern was upgrade able to happen Communication clear by myself after first attempt to upgrade but still problems as my communication not passed on
The install went very well The guys were helpful and efficient They were happy to explain the work involved and answer any questions I had
Awful Scheduled for a fibre cable installation today between 1 and 6pm on behalf of Vodafone Engineer calls up at 4pm saying its too dark to do the job so I need to schedule Now Im left without internet and appointments take weeks to rescheduleSo unprofessional terrible service It gets dark at approximately the same time every day seems like poor planning to me
Engineers were very polite and professional and got the job done in quick time with no mess would definitely recommend this service 👍🏻
The guys who came were very careful to wear protective shoes covers Aware of closing doors too even though working in and out doors Explained process and help set it up on my phone and explain about getting in touch with Talk Tslk as this was temporary because of being an I phone Very pleasant and jokey but never going too far Would recommend them
Never seen or experienced this new technology Was very impressed with installation and very much satisfied with the new installation Forest and Callum are very well experienced installers and got the installation done as required by me Will recommend City Fibre to relatives and friends and am very Happy with the new installation
City fibre engineers arrived early yesterday to install my broadband because it’s also a Digital Voice landline installation Installation team is professional they took care with my property being very careful about my garden and hiding the cable from view as much as possible They called City Fibre HQ to discuss the new cable and the phone line terminal is correctly located in my home bearing in mind that BT’s legacy landline had a different terminal in the street and different access point to my house Before leaving they checked my broadband is up and running on my laptop and WiFi and carried out speed tests Unfortunately my Vodafone telephone landline isn’t working which is a technical glitch with Vodafone switching the service from BTPlusnet My landline phone was correctly connected up by City Fibre installers using a specific connector through the router They told me to contact Vodafone if my phone still isn’t working next day I have done this Broadband works great Vodafone has taken responsibility to actualise the phone service
Julius Aedan was very polite and helpful and gave 100 in to his work Internet is now great
Julius Aeden gave us great service good job fast and efficient and very friendly company
Brilliant install this morning booked for between 1 and 6 and they got to me before 12 excellent timing excellent engineers well informed and definitely made decision making easier Neat and tidy job with the everything involved cant even tell a cables been laid through my driveway All round a brilliant first impression of CityFibre keep it up lads
Very efficient Lewis and Dan were very professional from the start introduced themselves showing I’d badges put on protective footwear although not needed kept me informed on what was happening clean and tidy  workers couldn’t fault them thanks guys
RUDE hung up on me whilst I was still talking Had to call back to discuss the issue which could have been resolved if the silly bugger didnt disconnect Needs retraining pronto
Frankie and Mark done a great job very friendly and helpful box looks great not to big very helpful with getting the app up and running
Brandon and Charlie were excellent installers Talked me through every step they were doing and got me set up in no time Would definitely have them come again 👍
Both engineers were very informative and happy to talk me through all of my queries They were well equipped and efficient They were considerate of my home taking off boots without asking
Stefan Martin and Natalie were fantastic today Very professional explained everything step by step They had a very difficult job to lay the cable but left everything as it was and you wouldn’t know anything had been done Everything neat and tidy in the house too Wonderful
Guys that installed fibre were very professional knew their stuff left house spotless I just hope I get better network than I had with talk talk as its been so bad no signal in bedrooms pixilated stations ontelly
Phoned in advance so I was ready for them Turned up on time explained what theyd do Id watched the YouTube video beforehand so knew what to expectCracked on with the job didnt make any mess at all Put up with rubbish weather and giddy dogCant fault them
There should be a clear guidance about the technical aspects for new connections There is no direct helpline to CityFibre I hope CityFibre teams up with at least one more service provider in near future
The guys were very professional tidy and friendly I am definitely happy with the job carried out by Stefan Martin and NatalieThanks guysJorge
Very polite engineers cleaned and tidy up the working area although is pouring down outside they took the time to do a brilliant job Service is running in 5 minutes since switched on Fantastic job guys Thanks you
I had requested through Vodafone a fibre optic broadband plan back on the 28th of March 2022After more than 3 months and so many hours wasted in callschatsemails to Vodafone I finally had to cancel in early July as City Fibre was not able to provide a network connection to my house The worst thing was that City Fibre was claiming that they had come to my house and successfully installed everything which was a lie That made VF consider me an active subscriber and start billing me without having any service at all On top of everything else VF requested that my current provider end my services which they did leaving me with no service voice  internet for 2 weeksAbsolutely disgusting experience  will never deal with them in the futureGeorge
City Fiber completed installation of our fiber into our property they kept us included and informed at all stages of the process Friendly and tidied everything up on completion
The installation  was done on time I was notified  in advance  of the Installation  time the called a few moments before to confirm the arrival  time The installers were communicative  about what they were doing and cleaned up after they finished
The installation process was very fast really nice and professional technician s  everything was perfect  thank you
15mins after the engineer left the broadband stopped working Leaving me no WiFi at home
Very efficient and friendly team led by AlexThanks
I had a phone call to say the engineers were on the way both conducted themselves very professionally  made sure internet was working before they left Im getting a lot faster speed than i was with my previous supplier
Finally after the 4th attempt Fibre installed The first teams that came were a joke and didnt seem to want to do the install After multiple conversations with both talk talk and city fibre they got a team out with the right tools and attitude so the 4 stars is purely for the two chaps that turned up today cracked on and got the job done 👍 Restored my faith a little but city fibre you should look at the engineers you use and maybe have a few more SLAs in place for the engineers not getting the job done
The engineers arrived on time and discussed the job before starting They were polite and friendly and worked efficiently They wore overshoes when inside my house and were careful to contain any news from drilling etc
Had the guys out today to cable and connect my fibre BB First class helpful professional and friendly Managed to navigate some curve balls the property threw at then too Highly recommended
Having been a customer with VirginMedia since the beginning of time NTL days for the seniors making this transition was a bit risky especially when being so reliant on internet but so far so good no complaints Engineers were great easy to chat with always kept me up to date with everything and yeah can’t fault it 
Engineer was professional
Quick and efficient installation of full fibre by a couple of polite and friendly guys
Job was clean tidy and on time Great job and helpful staff
Extremely long delay  2 months  between the failed installation date and eventual successful installation Very poor communication with ISP and me I had no idea of when an engineer would attend or whether it would get installed  but it works so I have to add a star for that
I am happy with the speed delivery reliability and the quality of service of the new product for now and the deal i got from the Vodafone company I wanted a good smart fast and reliable broadband that did the best and the Vodafone offered one that ticked all the boxes Speaking with James at the Preston outlet helped me get exactly what i was looking for and that is why i give 5 starts
Switched from Virgin to Vodaphone  very smooth experience  910mbps down 910mbps up  on a wired connection 420mbps down 520up WiFi connection  booster used and 230mbps down 311up on the second floor  very happy
Chris and Jordan did an excellent install despite some reoeated central office issues to do with missing access equipment
Perfect install
Excellent installation the team consisted of a Lad and a Lass They worked well together on what was a difficult installation having to run cables across several gardens Both were knowledgeable capable and explained everything They gave options and where to run cables and install boxes fitting everything where I preferred Perfect installation team
Arrived at the time they said they would told me what they was going to do and got the job done fast and clean Good service from CityFibre
The engineers turned up on time and successfully carried out the installation as required The big bonus point for me is the decision to go full fibre the connection is fast getting the same data uploads and downloads I am happy that I switched to this service Highly recommended
The engineers couldn’t nearly attach a power extension cable and left an untidy area with trailing wires I will have to fix this myself
The installation process was great and the engineers were very helpful and professional
Hi I Did switch from virgin media to city fiber yesterday and so far so good The speed test was showing perfectly on the first day On the second day it is slower but normally it takes a week to settle speed down to a house I believe
The engineers arrived late They left the walls broken and holes on the ceiling
